### When to Run Full Tests

Run comprehensive testing (sections 5-10) when:

- üîß **Initial deployment** - Before going live
- üõ†Ô∏è **Major flow changes** - Modified logic or expressions
- üêõ **After fixing bugs** - Validate fix didn't break other features
- üìã **Compliance audit** - Need complete test evidence
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Quick tests failed** - Need detailed diagnostics

**Time for full testing:** 2.5-3 hours

---

## Test Scope Overview

### What We're Testing

This guide covers comprehensive testing for **three Power Automate cloud flows** that automate the 3D print request management system:

| Flow | Purpose | Trigger Type | Key Features |
|------|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **Flow A (PR-Create)** | New request processing | SharePoint Create | ReqKey generation, filename validation, confirmation emails |
| **Flow B (PR-Audit)** | Change tracking & notifications | SharePoint Modify | Field change logging, automated emails, estimate confirmations |
| **Flow C (PR-Action)** | Staff action logging | Power Apps | Audit trail from dashboard actions |

### Why Testing Matters

‚úÖ **Prevent data loss** - Ensure audit trails are complete  
‚úÖ **Validate automations** - Confirm emails send correctly  
‚úÖ **Catch regressions** - Detect when changes break existing functionality  
‚úÖ **Build confidence** - Staff can trust the system works reliably  
‚úÖ **Document behavior** - Create evidence of testing for compliance

### Testing Philosophy (Microsoft Best Practices)

Based on Microsoft Power Automate documentation:

1. **Test early and often** - Use Flow Checker for real-time validation
2. **Test manually first** - Verify basic functionality before automation
3. **Use static results** - Mock data for testing without side effects
4. **Check error paths** - Don't just test happy paths
5. **Monitor run history** - Review execution details for issues
6. **Test with real users** - Validate with actual student/staff accounts

---

## Prerequisites

| Special Characters | Mary O'Connor | moconnor@lsu.edu | Apostrophe handling |
| Middle Name | John Q. Public | jqpublic@lsu.edu | Period/middle initial handling |

### Test File Attachments

Create these test files before starting:

**Valid Files:**
```
‚úì JaneDoe_Filament_Blue.stl (valid format)
‚úì MaryOConnor_Resin_Clear.obj (valid with special char name)
‚úì JohnQPublic_Filament_Red.3mf (valid with middle initial)
```

**Invalid Files:**
```

2. Wait 1 minute
3. Check AuditLog for this request

**Expected Result:**

**Two distinct audit entries created:**

1. **From Flow C** (Staff action):
   - Title: "Staff Action: Approved"
   - Action: Approved
   - FieldName: Status
   - ActorRole: Staff
   - ClientApp: Power Apps
   
2. **From Flow B** (Status change):
   - Title: "Status Change"
   - Action: Status Change
   - FieldName: Status
   - NewValue: Ready to Print
   - ActorRole: Staff
   - ClientApp: SharePoint Form

**Verification:**
- [ ] Both entries exist
- [ ] Different FlowRunIds
- [ ] Both have same NewValue
- [ ] No duplicates
- [ ] Timeline makes sense (Flow C first, then Flow B)

**Actual Result:**
```
Flow C entry created: [ ] Yes  [ ] No
Flow B entry created: [ ] Yes  [ ] No
Total entries: _______________
Duplicates: [ ] Yes  [ ] No (should be No)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

---

#### Issue: Flow B Not Creating Audit Entries

**Symptoms:**
- Flow B appears in run history with green checkmarks
- No field change entries in AuditLog

**Possible Causes:**
1. **System Update Condition Bug**
   - Check condition: `Skip if System Update`
   - Should be: `triggerOutputs()?['body/LastActionBy']` equals `System`
   - NOT: Double equals or wrong syntax

2. **Internal Field Names Wrong**
   - Verify: EstimatedWeight uses `EstWeight` (internal name)
   - Verify: EstimatedTime uses `EstHours` (internal name)
   - Check: SharePoint List Settings ‚Üí Column ‚Üí URL Field parameter

**Fix:**
1. Open Flow B in edit mode
2. Check "Skip if System Update" condition syntax
3. Verify all field expressions use correct internal names
4. Save and test again

---

#### Issue: Duplicate Audit Entries

**Symptoms:**
- Multiple identical entries for single change
- "Request Created" appears multiple times

**Possible Causes:**
1. Flow B processing System updates (condition not working)
2. Flow A and B both logging same action

**Fix:**
1. Verify System update condition in Flow B (see above)
2. Check LastActionBy field is set correctly
3. Ensure Flow A sets LastActionBy = System

---

#### Issue: Emails Not Sending

**Symptoms:**
- Flow completes but no email received
- Email action shows error in run history

**Possible Causes:**
1. Shared mailbox permission missing
2. Invalid recipient email
3. Email throttling

**Fix:**
1. Verify "Send As" permission for coad-fablab@lsu.edu
2. Check StudentEmail field is populated and valid
3. Review retry policy logs
4. Check spam/junk folder

---

#### Issue: RejectionReason Shows JSON in Email

**Symptoms:**
- Email shows: `{"@odata.type":"#Microsoft.Azure..."}`
- Or shows: `{"Design not printable":""}`

**Root Cause:**
- Multi-choice field not formatted correctly

**Fix:**
1. Open Flow B ‚Üí Find rejection email section
2. Before "Send Rejection Email", add:
   - **Select** action: `Format Rejection Reasons`
   - From: `outputs('Get_Current_Rejected_Data')?['body/RejectionReason']`
   - Map: **Switch to text mode** ‚Üí Type `@item()?['Value']`
3. Add **Compose** action: `join(body('Format_Rejection_Reasons'), '; ')`
4. Update email body to use Compose output
5. Save and test

---

#### Issue: EstimatedWeight Shows Empty in Audit Log

**Symptoms:**
- NewValue field blank when EstimatedWeight changed
- Notes says "EstimatedWeight updated to empty"

**Root Cause:**
- Using display name instead of internal name

**Fix:**
1. Open Flow B ‚Üí Find "Log EstimatedWeight Change" action
2. Update NewValue expression:
   - Change: `triggerOutputs()?['body/EstimatedWeight']`
   - To: `triggerOutputs()?['body/EstWeight']` (internal name)
3. Add null-safe handling:
   ```
   if(equals(triggerOutputs()?['body/EstWeight'], null), '', string(triggerOutputs()?['body/EstWeight']))
   ```
4. Save and test

---

#### Issue: Flow C Not Appearing in Power Apps

**Symptoms:**
- Can't find flow in Power Apps data sources
- .Run() method not available

**Fix:**
1. Verify flow is published and enabled
2. Power Apps Studio ‚Üí Data ‚Üí Refresh
3. Click **+ Add data** ‚Üí Power Automate ‚Üí Search for flow
4. If still missing, check flow owner has shared with app users
5. Verify trigger type is "Power Apps" (not SharePoint)

---

#### Issue: Infinite Loop (StudentConfirmed)

**Symptoms:**
- Status keeps changing repeatedly
- Flow B running continuously

**Root Cause:**
- Missing compound condition check

**Fix:**
1. Open Flow B ‚Üí Find StudentConfirmed detection
2. Verify compound condition:
   - Row 1: StudentConfirmed = true
   - **AND** (not OR)
   - Row 2: Status = Pending
3. This prevents re-processing when Status already = Ready to Print

---

### Flow Checker Usage

**To validate flows for errors:**

1. Open flow in edit mode
2. Top right ‚Üí Click **Flow checker** icon
3. Review:
   - **Errors** (red): Must fix before flow works
   - **Warnings** (yellow): Best practice recommendations
4. Click each issue for details and fix guidance
5. Save after fixing

**Common Flow Checker Warnings:**
- "Missing inputs" - Parameters not provided
- "Action timeout" - Configure retry policy
- "Concurrency control" - Enable for ordered processing

---

### Helpful Flow Run History Tips

**To debug failed flows:**

1. Power Automate ‚Üí My flows ‚Üí Flow name
2. Click **28-day run history**
3. Find failed run (red X icon)
4. Click run to open details
5. Each action shows:
   - **Inputs** - What data was provided
   - **Outputs** - What data was produced
   - **Duration** - How long it took
6. Look for:
   - Skipped actions (grey)
   - Failed actions (red X)
   - Error messages in outputs

**Copy Flow Run ID for Reference:**
- Run history ‚Üí Click run ‚Üí URL contains run ID
- Example: `/runs/08586653536760461208`
- Store this with test results for traceability

### SharePoint Internal Field Names Reference

When building flow expressions, use these internal names:

| Display Name | Internal Name | Type |
|--------------|---------------|------|
| EstimatedWeight | EstWeight | Number |
| EstimatedTime | EstHours | Number |
| EstimatedCost | EstimatedCost | Currency |
| Status | Status | Choice |
| Method | Method | Choice |
| Color | Color | Choice |
| Priority | Priority | Choice |
| Printer | Printer | Choice |
| Notes | Notes | Multiple lines |
| Student | Student | Person |
| LastActionBy | LastActionBy | Single line text |

**How to Find Internal Names:**
1. SharePoint ‚Üí PrintRequests ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí List settings
2. Under Columns, click field name
3. Look at URL: `Field=InternalName`

---

### Testing Best Practices (Microsoft Guidance)

Based on Power Automate documentation:

‚úÖ **Test early** - Use Flow Checker during development  
‚úÖ **Test manually** - Verify basic functionality before automation  
‚úÖ **Use Test pane** - Built-in testing in flow designer  
‚úÖ **Check run history** - Review execution details  
‚úÖ **Test error paths** - Don't just test happy paths  
‚úÖ **Monitor performance** - Watch for slow actions  
‚úÖ **Document results** - Keep test evidence  
‚úÖ **Test with real data** - Use actual student/staff accounts
