Quick verdict
Your Microsoft MVP is absolutely buildable as written (SharePoint lists, a customized SharePoint form for students, a Canvas staff console, and three flows) and has a clear scope: internal-only, attachments-based storage, staff attribution on every action, and an AuditLog. That baseline is consistent across your materials. 
Below are the specific gaps and fixes.

1) Mismatches & omissions between “Masterplan” and the Microsoft build
A. Status model is not aligned (naming + flow).
	• Masterplan uses: Uploaded → Pending → ReadyToPrint → Printing → Completed → PaidPickedUp (+ Rejected/Archived). 
	• Build Guide uses many different labels (e.g., Submitted, Intake Review, Needs Info, Approved, Queued, Ready for Pickup, Picked Up, etc.), and the staff console filters a subset that doesn’t map 1:1 to the Masterplan’s directory-backed statuses. This can cause confusion, broken analytics later, and migration pain. 
Fix: add a “Status Mapping” table to the Build Guide that explicitly maps Microsoft statuses to Masterplan statuses (or rename the Microsoft statuses now to match the Masterplan’s canonical set to avoid technical debt).
B. “Open in slicer” / authoritative file selection.
The Masterplan requires an explicit authoritative-file selection and a protocol-handler–based “open in slicer” workflow—both are missing from the Microsoft MVP. If staff can’t reliably open the correct file or designate the authoritative one, you’ll get re-print errors. 
Fix: add one of these Microsoft-first patterns:
	• Minimal: a “PrimaryAttachment” single line column; staff set it via the staff app (“Set Authoritative”).
	• Stronger: a Flow that, on “Approved,” copies the chosen attachment into a Document Library folder (by ReqKey) and writes that library path back to the item (this is your Microsoft equivalent of the Masterplan’s file move). Note you already hint “doc library later if you outgrow attachments”—make it an explicit future step. 
Validation parity (size/type).
Masterplan enforces file type/size limits; Microsoft plan only enables attachments without constraints. This is a silent foot-gun (huge files or unsupported types). 
Fix: document and enforce a house rule:
	• “Only .stl / .obj / .3mf accepted; recommended max 50 MB.”
	• Teach staff to reject items that violate this (and optionally add a Flow that emails the reason).
E. Notifications flow is optional—but operationally critical.
Your Microsoft guide lists “Needs Info / Ready for Pickup” notifications as optional; in practice they’re daily work. Make them part of the core build. 

2) Gaps & weak spots inside the Microsoft build itself
1) Permissions clarity (students vs staff).
You do set item-level permissions (students see only their items) and recommend a private Team site—but the plan should explicitly state where non-staff students submit from (SharePoint list form link vs a public page) and confirm they’ll authenticate with LSU accounts. 
2) AuditLog completeness.
You’ve got three flows: create/acknowledge, field-change audit, and action-log from Power Apps. That’s great. But the guide should explicitly list which fields the PR-Audit flow watches and whether it logs old→new value for each (it appears to, but spell it out so you can QA it). 
3) Status choices bloat.
The list’s Status includes many rarely-used states (Paused, Failed, Canceled). “Surface area” increases errors and filter confusion. Consider trimming for MVP to your most-used 6–7. 
4) Attachments lifecycle & versioning.
You enable list versioning (items) but say nothing about attachment lifecycle (duplicates, overwrites, deletions). Add a policy: “Staff should not delete student attachments; if a new slice is uploaded, set ‘PrimaryAttachment’ instead of removing older files.” 
5) Testing plan depth.
You include a quick test plan; extend it to cover:
	• Needs Info roundtrip (email + student edit)
	• Attachment added/removed and corresponding AuditLog entries. 

3) Risky assumptions (call them out explicitly)
	• Attachments will scale “well enough.” They’re fine to start, but if you hit storage/preview/rename limits, moving to a Document Library per ReqKey will be your first migration. You already anticipate this—mark it as Phase 2 with a migration playbook. 
	• Power Apps staff console will be used by multiple staff at once. Without locking, the last writer wins. (Add locking now; it’s cheap.)
	• Students will always use LSU accounts. If you later invite non-LSU collaborators, the item-level permissions pattern changes.
	• Status breadth equals clarity. In practice, more statuses → more mistakes. Trim for day-one.

4) Concrete improvements (low lift, high impact)
A. Align the status model now.
Publish a single truth table (Microsoft ↔ Masterplan). Either:
	• Rename the list choices to Masterplan’s canonical set, or
	• Add a mapping column and enforce translation in the staff app.
B. Add “Set Authoritative File” and a future “Move to Library” step.
	• New columns: PrimaryAttachment (text), PrimarySetBy (Person), PrimarySetAt (DateTime).
	• Optional Flow (Phase 2): On “Approved,” move the primary file into Files/<ReqKey>/ in a document library and store the link.
D. Codify file rules in the student form.
	• Add visible helper text: allowed types (.stl, .obj, .3mf) and a size guideline (e.g., ≤50 MB). If a submission violates, staff click “Needs Info” to email the policy link.
E. Make notifications part of core (not optional).
	• Ship PR-Notify: Needs Info and PR-Notify: Ready for Pickup now; stamp AuditLog with “Email Sent.” 
F. Expand the test checklist.
	• Needs-Info loop, and attachment mutations to your “Part 4 — Testing.” 

5) What’s already strong (keep it)
	• Item-level permissions on PrintRequests (+ private Team site). This is the simplest, safest start. 
	• Three-flow architecture (ReqKey/acknowledge, field-change audit, action logger) + the AuditLog list. It’s clean and extensible. 
	• Staff console Patch patterns (including correct Person “claims” structure) and the “gotchas” notes about delegation. 
	• Quick test plan and time estimates—great for setting expectations. 

TL;DR action list (Microsoft MVP)
	1. Unify statuses (trim to a tight set and map to Masterplan). 
	2. Add PrimaryAttachment + Locking columns and wire them in the staff app.
	3. Make Needs-Info and Ready-for-Pickup required flows (not optional). 
	4. Put file rules (types/size) into the student form’s visible instructions.
	5. Extend Part 4 — Testing to include attachment edits.
