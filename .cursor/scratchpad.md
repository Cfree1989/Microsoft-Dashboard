## Background and Motivation

We need to enforce a filename policy for student-submitted SharePoint list attachments without renaming files in place (to avoid link churn and confusion). The system should accept submissions whose attachment filenames follow the convention and auto-reject those that do not, notifying the student with clear instructions.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- SharePoint list attachments cannot be truly renamed; rename implies re-upload/delete, which can break links and user expectations.
- We want a low-risk, clear UX: keep the original attachment untouched, enforce naming via policy and automated validation.
- Filenames must match: FirstLast_Method_Color.ext
  - Allowed extensions: stl, obj, 3mf, idea, form (case-insensitive)
  - Must have exactly three underscore-separated segments before the extension; each non-empty.
  - Student display names may include middle names/initials; Step 3 already generates a cleaned base name used elsewhere but is not used to rename.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1) Add attachment retrieval loop
   - After Step 3 (Generate Standardized Filename), add "Get attachments" (SharePoint) and an "Apply to each" over its `value`.
   - Set loop Concurrency = 1.

2) Implement filename validation Condition inside the loop
   - Expression (replace `Apply_to_each` with your loop name if different):
   ```
   and(
     or(
       equals(toLower(last(split(items('Apply_to_each')?['Name'], '.'))), 'stl'),
       equals(toLower(last(split(items('Apply_to_each')?['Name'], '.'))), 'obj'),
       equals(toLower(last(split(items('Apply_to_each')?['Name'], '.'))), '3mf'),
       equals(toLower(last(split(items('Apply_to_each')?['Name'], '.'))), 'idea'),
       equals(toLower(last(split(items('Apply_to_each')?['Name'], '.'))), 'form')
     ),
     equals(length(split(first(split(items('Apply_to_each')?['Name'], '.')), '_')), 3),
     greater(length(first(split(first(split(items('Apply_to_each')?['Name'], '.')), '_'))), 0),
     greater(length(first(skip(split(first(split(items('Apply_to_each')?['Name'], '.')), '_'), 1))), 0),
     greater(length(last(split(first(split(items('Apply_to_each')?['Name'], '.')), '_'))), 0)
   )
   ```

3) Yes (valid) branch
   - Proceed with current flow steps (Update item, AuditLog, Confirmation email) for this item.
   - Optionally add an "AuditLog" entry noting "Attachment filename valid".

4) No (invalid) branch
   - Update the `PrintRequests` item:
     - `Status` = `Rejected`
     - `NeedsAttention` = `Yes`
     - `LastAction` = `Rejected`
     - `LastActionBy` = `System`
     - `LastActionAt` = `@{utcNow()}`
   - Create `AuditLog` item:
     - `Title` = `Rejected: Invalid filename`
     - `ReqKey`, `RequestID`, `ActionAt`, `FlowRunId` populated per existing pattern
     - `Notes` = include the offending filename `items('Apply_to_each')?['Name']`
   - Send rejection email to the student with rename instructions and accepted extensions.
   - Terminate the flow for this item (Status = Failed or Canceled) to prevent confirmation email from sending.

5) Guard confirmation email
   - Ensure the confirmation email step only executes on the valid path.
   - If email currently sits outside the loop, guard it with a check that all attachments were valid (for single-attachment scenario, checking the Condition is sufficient).

6) Documentation updates
   - Update `PowerAutomate/PR-Create_SetReqKey_Acknowledge.md` to add the new validation step, condition expression, and rejection path.
   - Add the filename policy text to the SharePoint form and to the doc.

## Project Status Board (active)

1. Add Get attachments + Apply to each after Step 3 [pending]
2. Add filename validation Condition in loop [pending]
3. Wire valid branch to proceed with existing Update/Audit/Email [pending]
4. Implement reject branch: Update item, AuditLog, rejection email, terminate [pending]
5. Guard confirmation email to run only when valid [pending]
6. Add filename policy text to SharePoint form [pending]
7. Update `PR-Create_SetReqKey_Acknowledge.md` documentation [pending]
8. Test matrix: valid/invalid names and all allowed extensions [pending]

## Success Criteria

- Valid filenames (matching pattern + allowed extension) result in normal processing and confirmation email.
- Invalid filenames cause: item marked Rejected, NeedsAttention = Yes, AuditLog entry created, and rejection email sent. No confirmation email is sent.
- Supports extensions: stl, obj, 3mf, idea, form (case-insensitive).
- No attachment rename is attempted; original attachment remains as submitted.

## Quick Reference (expressions and fields)

- Condition expression for validation (inside Apply to each): see Task 2 above.
- Offending name in emails/logs: `items('Apply_to_each')?['Name']`
- Time: `utcNow()`
- Flow run id: `workflow()['run']['name']`

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### üîß EXECUTOR MODE: RejectionReason Multi-Choice Field Fix - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Status**: COMPLETED - Fixed complex object array formatting in rejection emails
**Issue**: Testing rejection email automation produced three iterations of issues:
1. Initial error: `'The template language expression 'outputs('Get_Current_Rejected_Data')?['body/RejectionReason']?['Value']' cannot be evaluated because property 'Value' cannot be selected. Array elements can only be selected using an integer index.'`
2. After first fix: Email showed raw JSON objects: `{"@odata.type":"#Microsoft.Azure.Connectors.SharePoint.SPListExpandedReference","Id":1,"Value":"Design not printable..."}`
3. After second fix: Email showed key-value objects: `{"Design not printable...":""}`
**Root Cause**: `RejectionReason` is a multi-choice SharePoint field that returns an **array of complex objects** (each with `@odata.type`, `Id`, and `Value` properties), not simple strings
**Solution Applied**: 
- Added **Action 4: Format Rejection Reasons** - Select action with **text mode Map field**:
  - From: `outputs('Get_Current_Rejected_Data')?['body/RejectionReason']`
  - Map: Click "Switch to text mode" button ‚Üí Type `@item()?['Value']`
- Added **Action 5: Compose Formatted Reasons Text** - Compose action that joins values: `join(body('Format_Rejection_Reasons'), '; ')`
- Updated email body to reference formatted output: `@{outputs('Compose_Formatted_Reasons_Text')}`
- Result: Multiple selections display as "Reason 1; Reason 2; Reason 3" instead of JSON objects
**Documentation Updated**: PR-Audit_LogChanges.md - Added two new data operations actions before Send Rejection Email; updated email body template; renumbered subsequent actions; documented "Switch to text mode" requirement for Map field
**Key Learning**: SharePoint multi-choice fields return arrays of complex objects with `Id` and `Value` properties; cannot use simple `join()` directly; must use Select action with **text mode Map field** (not visual mode) to extract `Value` properties first, then join the resulting array; visual mode creates unwanted key-value pairs
**Time Invested**: 25 minutes total (5 min initial fix + 10 min revised fix + 10 min text mode troubleshooting)
**Testing Result**: ‚úÖ Rejection emails now display clean readable text like "Design not printable (overhangs, thin walls, unsupported features); File size too large"

### üóÇÔ∏è CURATOR MODE: PR-Audit Documentation Reorganization - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Status**: COMPLETED - File successfully reorganized with zero scrolling needed
**Issue Resolved**: PR-Audit_LogChanges.md now has complete instructions at every step with no forward/backward references
**Changes Made**:
- **Step 6b**: Expanded from abbreviated "copy from above" to 8 complete field detectors with ALL fields explicitly listed
- **Step 7**: Expanded from "see templates below" to 3 complete email workflows (Rejection, Pending, Completion) with inline HTML templates and complete audit log field mappings
- **Reference Material**: Deleted 240 lines of redundant duplicate content
**Results**:
- File reduced from 1,290 to ~1,050 lines
- Zero forward/backward references remain
- Every Create item action shows all 15 fields explicitly
- HTML templates inline right where you paste them
**Time Invested**: 45 minutes total with user approvals at each section

- None yet. If multiple attachments per item must all be valid before confirming, we may add an aggregate validity flag (Initialize variable before loop, set false on any invalid, check after loop).

## Lessons

- Avoid in-place rename of list attachments; prefer policy + validation to maintain link stability.

## Feature Plan: Job Card Attachments (Dashboard "Add File" Button)

### Background and Motivation
- Staff want to add files to a request directly from the dashboard job card, without navigating to SharePoint.
- Each `PrintRequests` item can hold multiple attachments; we need a simple in-app upload path with attribution (who added the file), and a clear list of files on the card.

### UX Plan
- **Collapsed job card**
  - **Attachments chip**: shows count (e.g., ‚Äú3 files‚Äù).
  - **Add File button**: opens an in-app modal to attach files.
  - Optional: show the most recent 1‚Äì2 filenames.
- **Expanded job card**
  - **Attachments list**: shows all files by name (most-recent first); clicking opens the file in SharePoint.
  - **Add File button**: same as collapsed view.
- **Add File modal** (overlay)
  - **Required person selector**: ‚ÄúWho is adding this file?‚Äù (ComboBox bound to `Staff` list).
  - **Upload area**: attachment picker (one or multiple files in a single submit).
  - **Actions**: Save (uploads and logs), Cancel.

### Technical Approach
- **Data**: Use SharePoint list attachments on the `PrintRequests` item (no new libraries needed).
- **Display attachments**:
  - Use a small Display Form (`frmAttachmentsView`) bound to the selected request and include only the Attachments data card; place it in both collapsed (limited height) and expanded (full list) layouts.
- **Upload/remove attachments (modal, no drag-and-drop)**
  - Add an Edit Form (`frmAttachmentsEdit`) bound to `PrintRequests`, `Item = varSelectedRequest`, include only the Attachments data card.
  - Button `Add/Remove Files` ‚Üí `Set(varShowAddFileModal, true); ResetForm(frmAttachmentsEdit); Set(varSelectedActor, Blank()); Set(varAttachmentChangeType, Blank()); Set(varAttachmentChangedName, Blank())`.
  - Modal shows: required person picker, the Attachments card (supports add and delete), and Save/Cancel.
  - Modal Save ‚Üí `If(IsBlank(varSelectedActor), Notify("Select your name", NotificationType.Error), SubmitForm(frmAttachmentsEdit))`.
  - `OnSuccess` of `frmAttachmentsEdit` ‚Üí Patch audit fields and close modal:
    - `Patch(PrintRequests, frmAttachmentsEdit.LastSubmit, { LastAction: If(varAttachmentChangeType="Removed","File Removed","File Added"), LastActionBy: varSelectedActor, LastActionAt: Now() })`
    - Optionally call Flow C (`PR-Action_LogAction`) with `Action = If(varAttachmentChangeType="Removed","File Removed","File Added")`, `Notes = Coalesce(varAttachmentChangedName, "")`.
  - Note: Canvas Attachments card supports selecting multiple files and deleting existing ones; no drag-and-drop.

### Attribution & Audit
- **Attribution**: Require selection of the actor (person picker) in the modal; store in `LastActionBy`. SharePoint will also set `Modified By` to the signed-in user.
- **Audit**: Existing `PR-Audit_LogChanges` Flow Step 5 (‚ÄúAttachments Change Detection‚Äù) will log "File Added" entries automatically for each uploaded file.
- **Optional explicit log**: Also invoke `PR-Action_LogAction` from Power Apps to write a single, human-readable action entry ("File Added") with the selected actor and context notes.

### Success Criteria
- From the job card, staff can add one or multiple files without leaving the app.
- Attachments list is visible on the job card (count in collapsed view; full list in expanded view).
- Actor is captured (required) and appears as `LastActionBy`; `LastAction` updates to "File Added"; `PR-Audit` logs show file names.
- Errors show user-friendly notifications; UI disables while uploading.

### Open Decisions
- **File constraints**: Enforce client-side limits (types/size) or rely on policy only for MVP.
- **Deletion**: Expose a remove action in expanded view (staff-only) or keep read-only list in MVP.

### Task Breakdown (Planner ‚Üí Executor)
1. Add attachments Display Form to job card (collapsed count + expanded list).
2. Add `Add File` button and modal state (`varShowAddFileModal`).
3. Build `frmAttachmentsEdit` with only the Attachments data card.
4. Add required person picker bound to `Staff` (`varSelectedActor`), with validation.
5. Wire Save: `SubmitForm(frmAttachmentsEdit)` ‚Üí `OnSuccess` Patch `LastAction/By/At`; optional call to `PR-Action_LogAction`.
6. Add loading/disabled states and error notifications; refresh item post-upload.
7. Manual test matrix: single/multi-file, attribution required, audit entries recorded, collapsed/expanded views render correctly.
8. Documentation: Update `PowerApps/StaffConsole-AppSpec.md` and `PowerAutomate/PR-Audit_LogChanges.md` to reflect the new UI path.

### Risks & Mitigations
- DnD not native in Canvas ‚Üí Mitigate with Option B (launch SP form) for immediate DnD; revisit PCF later.
- Shared devices ‚Üí Require explicit actor selection; compare to `User().Email` and optionally warn on mismatch.
- Large files ‚Üí Provide guidance to use document library if needed; rely on tenant limits.

### Quick Reference (formulas)
- Add File button:
  - `Set(varShowAddFileModal, true); ResetForm(frmAttachmentsEdit); Set(varSelectedActor, Blank())`
- Modal Save button:
  - `If(IsBlank(varSelectedActor), Notify("Select your name", NotificationType.Error), SubmitForm(frmAttachmentsEdit))`
- `OnSuccess` (frmAttachmentsEdit):
  - `Patch(PrintRequests, frmAttachmentsEdit.LastSubmit, { LastAction: "File Added", LastActionBy: varSelectedActor, LastActionAt: Now() }); Set(varShowAddFileModal, false)`

# Microsoft Dashboard - 3D Print Queue System
*Planning & Implementation Tracker*

## Background and Motivation

### Project Context
Building a **comprehensive 3D Print Request Queue Management System** for LSU's Fabrication Lab using entirely Microsoft Power Platform technologies. The system must handle student submissions, staff workflow management, complete audit trails, and maintain security/privacy requirements.

### Key Requirements
- **Internal LSU accounts only** (no external access)
- **No workstation authentication** dependencies  
- **File management via SharePoint** (attachments on list items)
- **Complete staff attribution** on every action
- **Full audit logging** of all changes and activities
- **Item-level security** (students see only their requests)
- **No analytics/reporting** in MVP (keep simple)
- **No-code/low-code approach** with ready-to-use formulas

### Success Criteria
‚úÖ Students can submit 3D print requests with file attachments  
‚úÖ Staff can manage queue through intuitive interface  
‚úÖ All actions are logged with proper attribution  
‚úÖ Email notifications work automatically  
‚úÖ Security model prevents data leaks between students  
‚úÖ System is maintainable by non-technical staff

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges Identified
1. **Person Field Complexity**: SharePoint Person columns require specific claim formatting in Power Apps
2. **Delegation Warnings**: Large datasets may trigger delegation warnings in Power Apps galleries  
3. **Flow Reliability**: Power Automate flows need error handling for production use
4. **Permission Complexity**: Item-level permissions + staff access requires careful setup
5. **Field Mapping**: Internal column names vs display names can cause confusion

### Risk Assessment  
- **HIGH**: PowerShell script execution (requires proper permissions)
- **MEDIUM**: Power Apps Person field patching (technical syntax)  
- **LOW**: SharePoint list creation (well-documented process)
- **LOW**: Flow building (step-by-step guides provided)

### Architectural Decisions Made
- **SharePoint Lists over SQL**: Native M365 integration, built-in security
- **Attachments over Document Library**: Simpler for MVP, easier association
- **Canvas App over Model-Driven**: More control over UX for staff workflows  
- **Multiple Flows over Single**: Better error isolation and maintainability

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### üéâ EXECUTOR MODE: Phase 2 Power Automate Flows Complete - ‚úÖ ALL FLOWS OPERATIONAL
**Status**: COMPLETED - All 4 Power Automate flows built, tested, and working correctly
**Achievement**: Successfully completed Phase 2 - Power Automate automation layer fully operational
**Deliverables**: 
- ‚úÖ **Flow A (PR-Create)**: ReqKey generation, filename validation, confirmation emails
- ‚úÖ **Flow B (PR-Audit)**: Field change detection, status-based emails (Rejected, Pending, Completed)
- ‚úÖ **Flow C (PR-Action)**: Staff action logging from Power Apps with JSON responses
- ‚úÖ **Flow D (PR-Confirm)**: SharePoint-based student estimate confirmation (no HTTP trigger needed)
**Technical Implementation**:
- All flows use proper error handling with exponential retry policies
- Complete audit trail logging with FlowRunId, timestamps, and actor attribution
- Shared mailbox integration for consistent email sender identity
- SharePoint item-level security working correctly
- No infinite loop issues - proper System update prevention in place
**Testing Completed**:
- Field change detection verified for all tracked fields (Status, Priority, Color, Printer, Method, EstimatedTime, EstimatedWeight, EstimatedCost, Notes)
- Email workflows tested for Rejected, Pending, and Completed status changes
- Student estimate confirmation workflow tested end-to-end
- Attachment validation working (filename policy enforcement with email notifications)
- Multi-choice rejection reasons formatting correctly in emails
**Key Learnings Applied**:
- SharePoint internal field names verified (EstWeight, EstHours, EstimatedCost)
- Multi-choice field handling with Select action and text mode mapping
- Null-safe expressions for number fields
- Race condition prevention between Flow A and Flow B
**Time Investment**: ~5 hours total (slightly under original 5-6 hour estimate)
**Next Steps**: Ready for Phase 3 (Power Apps development) - all backend automation in place
**Business Value**: Complete automated workflow from submission ‚Üí audit logging ‚Üí email notifications ‚Üí estimate approval ‚Üí status tracking

### üîß EXECUTOR MODE: Flow B Number Field Internal Name Fix - ‚úÖ COMPLETED & TESTED
**Status**: COMPLETED & TESTED - Fixed empty NewValue in audit logs for EstimatedWeight and EstimatedTime changes; all field detectors now working
**Issue**: When testing Flow B, changing EstimatedWeight from 200 to 100 created audit logs but NewValue column was empty, Notes showed "EstimatedWeight updated to empty"
**Initial Hypothesis (WRONG)**: Number fields returning null when empty; needed null-safe handling
**BFROS Analysis Path**: 
1. ‚ùå Null/empty values - Added null checks, still empty
2. ‚ùå Missing OldValue implementation - Documented as intentional
3. ‚ùå Expression syntax - Verified correct Power Automate syntax
4. ‚úÖ **ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE: SharePoint internal field name mismatch**
**Real Root Cause**: SharePoint display name "EstimatedWeight" ‚â† internal name "EstWeight"; using `triggerOutputs()?['body/EstimatedWeight']` returned null because field doesn't exist in trigger outputs; correct internal names verified: EstimatedWeight‚Üí`EstWeight`, EstimatedTime‚Üí`EstHours`, EstimatedCost‚Üí`EstimatedCost`
**Solution Applied**: 
- Updated expression to use correct internal field name: `triggerOutputs()?['body/EstWeight']`
- Added warning in documentation about verifying internal field names via SharePoint List Settings ‚Üí Column URL
- Added null-safe handling as secondary protection: `if(equals(triggerOutputs()?['body/EstWeight'], null), '', string(triggerOutputs()?['body/EstWeight']))`
**Debug Method Used**: Added debug Create item action to check raw trigger inputs, revealed `"item/Notes": "EstimatedWeight updated to empty"` proving trigger didn't contain EstimatedWeight field
**Key Learning**: ALWAYS verify SharePoint internal field names in List Settings before building Power Automate expressions; display names frequently differ from internal names (e.g., EstimatedWeight ‚Üí EstWeight); check column URL Field parameter to find true internal name
**Documentation Updated**: 
- PR-Audit_LogChanges.md - Updated EstimatedWeight expression to use `EstWeight` internal name (line 222)
- PR-Audit_LogChanges.md - Added warning about internal field names for EstimatedTime/EstimatedCost (lines 185-188)
- scratchpad.md Lessons - Added "SharePoint Internal Field Names" critical lesson
**Time Invested**: 35 minutes total (including false starts with null handling, debugging accidental markdown paste)
**Context7 Used**: ‚úÖ Referenced Microsoft Power Automate official documentation for trigger outputs and SharePoint field name conventions
**Testing Results**: All field changes now creating audit logs with correct NewValue populated; OldValue intentionally blank per design
**Final Status**: Flow B fully operational with correct internal field names for EstWeight, EstHours, EstimatedCost

### üîß EXECUTOR MODE: Flow B Attachment Count Fix - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Status**: COMPLETED - Successfully resolved cascading null handling issues in attachment detection
**Issue**: Multiple template errors due to null values in attachment counting logic when testing items without attachments
**Root Cause**: SharePoint items without AttachmentCount field populated causing null reference errors in length() and int() functions
**Solution Applied**: 
1. ‚ùå `coalesce()` approach - Power Automate rejected expression syntax
2. ‚úÖ Fixed `Current_Attachment_Count`: `if(equals(outputs('Get_Current_Attachments')?['body/value'], null), 0, length(outputs('Get_Current_Attachments')?['body/value']))`
3. ‚úÖ Fixed `Check_Attachments_Changed`: `not(equals(outputs('Current_Attachment_Count'), if(equals(outputs('Get_Current_Item')?['body/AttachmentCount'], null), 0, int(outputs('Get_Current_Item')?['body/AttachmentCount']))))`
**Key Learning**: Power Automate expressions need explicit null checks with `if(equals(value, null), fallback, function(value))` pattern before type conversion functions like `int()` and `length()`
**Result**: Flow B now runs successfully on items with/without attachments and with/without populated AttachmentCount field
**Time Invested**: 25 minutes
**Documentation Updated**: PR-Audit_LogChanges.md expressions corrected; Lessons section enhanced with null handling pattern

### üîß EXECUTOR MODE: Flow B Attachment Count Logic Analysis - ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Status**: COMPLETED - Flow logic working correctly, identified real issue
**Issue**: User expected count 1‚Üí2 but got 1‚Üí0 when "adding" attachment
**Analysis Results**: Examined trigger raw outputs - `"{HasAttachments}": false` confirms item has 0 attachments
**Root Cause Identified**: Attachment upload process failing, not flow logic issue
- Previous state: 1 attachment (AttachmentCount = 1)  
- Current state: 0 attachments (HasAttachments = false)
- Flow correctly updated AttachmentCount from 1 to 0
**Key Insight**: Flow B attachment detection working perfectly - real issue is attachment not being saved to SharePoint
**Recommendation**: Debug attachment upload process (SharePoint form, Power Apps, or manual upload)
**Time Invested**: 30 minutes total
**Result**: Flow B attachment counting logic verified as accurate and reliable

### üîß EXECUTOR MODE: Flow A/B Race Condition Fix - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Status**: COMPLETED - Fixed timing conflict and corrected confusing documentation
**Issue**: AttachmentCount defaults to 1 but Flow B sets it to 0 when Flow A updates trigger Flow B during item creation
**Root Cause**: Flow A updates item ‚Üí triggers Flow B ‚Üí Flow B runs before attachments are fully available ‚Üí counts 0 attachments
**Solution Applied**: Added condition-based exclusion as Step 2 (right after trigger) that wraps ALL Flow B logic
**Documentation Fixed**: Completely reorganized PR-Audit_LogChanges.md with proper step numbering:
- Step 2: Race condition prevention (wraps everything)
- Step 3: Get Changes for Item  
- Step 4: Field Change Detection
- Step 5: Status Email Notifications
- Step 6: Attachment Detection
**Key Pattern**: `equals(LastActionBy, 'System')` prevents Flow B during any System updates (Flow A or Flow B itself)
**Time Invested**: 15 minutes total
**Result**: Clear, logical documentation structure with race condition prevention properly positioned

### üîß PLANNER MODE: Documentation Field Name Correction - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Status**: COMPLETED - Critical documentation accuracy issue resolved
**Issue**: PR-Audit_LogChanges.md Step 3a referenced "Editor Claims" field that doesn't exist in Power Automate interface
**Resolution**: Updated all 3 instances of "Editor Claims" to correct field name "Modified By Claims"

**Changes Made**: 
- Line 83: Status Change logging section - Actor Claims field corrected
- Line 386: Advanced Implementation Notes - Person field resolution guidance updated  
- Line 487: Attachment Change Detection section - Actor Claims field corrected  
- **Additional Fix**: Lines 481, 486, 492 - Corrected attachment DisplayName references to use "Name" field
- **Expression Format Fix**: Updated all NewValue field references to use Expression format with `triggerOutputs()?['body/FieldName']` syntax instead of Dynamic content references
- **Verified**: No remaining instances of "Editor Claims" in the file, all field references corrected for actual Power Automate interface

**Root Cause Identified**: Documentation written using conceptual names vs actual Power Automate UI field names
**Impact**: Implementation blocker removed - users can now find the correct field during flow construction

**Field Name Clarifications**:
1. **Person Field Issue**:
   - ‚ùå **Incorrect**: "Editor Claims" (conceptual name in documentation)
   - ‚úÖ **Correct**: "Modified By Claims" (actual Power Automate field name)
   - **Purpose**: Represents the person who last modified the SharePoint item for audit trail attribution

2. **Attachment Field Issue**:
   - ‚ùå **Incorrect**: "DisplayName" (SharePoint property name in documentation)
   - ‚úÖ **Correct**: "Name" (actual Power Automate field name)
   - **Purpose**: Represents the file name of SharePoint list attachments

3. **Expression Format Issue**:
   - ‚ùå **Incorrect**: Dynamic content references for trigger data (causes template validation errors)
   - ‚úÖ **Correct**: Expression format `triggerOutputs()?['body/FieldName']` for SharePoint trigger data
   - **Purpose**: Proper syntax for accessing SharePoint item field values in Power Automate expressions

**Time Invested**: 20 minutes total (including follow-up fixes)
**Final Resolution**: All field references corrected, Actor Claims expressions fixed, warning added to prevent future confusion
**Status**: User's template validation error resolved - flow will now save successfully

**Dashboard Design**: Created complete Power Apps Canvas app design guide matching Dashboard.png - clean navigation, no refresh functionality needed (Power Apps handles data updates natively)  
**Lightbulb Toggle Feature**: Enhanced dashboard with animated glow effects for job attention management - lightbulb ON/OFF toggle with pulsing gold animation, requires NeedsAttention (Yes/No) SharePoint field  
**UI Refinement**: Removed "Open File" button from action buttons since SharePoint attachments don't support external launch functionality  
**Archive Button Implementation**: Added complete Power Fx implementation for Archive button with proper flow integration, error handling, and user feedback notifications  
**Rejection Modal System**: Implemented comprehensive rejection modal with mandatory staff dropdown, multiple rejection reason checkboxes, custom comments, and proper validation - matches masterplan design for shared workstation accountability  
**Client-Side File Validation**: Enhanced student submission form with real-time file format (.stl/.obj/.3mf) and size (150MB) validation, preventing invalid submissions from reaching staff - removed file format/size from rejection reasons since they're now prevented at source

### üö® CRITICAL ANALYSIS RECEIVED (ChatGPT Review)
**Status**: NEW - Requires immediate planning decisions before implementation

| LastActionBy | Person | Auto-filled | Accountability tracking |
| LastActionAt | Date and Time | Auto-filled timestamp | Audit trail timing |

### Printer Selection with Build Plate Dimensions

**Students will see size constraints to self-select appropriate printer:**

| Printer | Method | Build Plate (inches) | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------------------|-------|
| Prusa MK4S | Filament | 9.8 √ó 8.3 √ó 8.7 | High-quality FDM, good for detailed work |
| Prusa XL | Filament | 14.2 √ó 14.2 √ó 14.2 | Large format FDM, multi-color capable |
| Raised3D Pro 2 Plus | Filament | 12.0 √ó 12.0 √ó 13.4 | Professional FDM, reliable for complex prints |
| Form 3 | Resin | 5.7 √ó 5.7 √ó 7.3 | SLA printer, high detail, limited to resin method |

**UX Design**: When student selects "Resin" method, printer choices filter to show only Form 3. When selecting "Filament", all FDM printers display with their build volumes in inches.

### Benefits of Refined Structure
‚úÖ **Student Experience**: Simplified from 15+ fields to 9 focused project fields  
‚úÖ **Staff Control**: All technical decisions (infill, layer height, supports) managed by experts  
‚úÖ **Self-Service Sizing**: Students see build plate dimensions and select appropriate printer  
‚úÖ **Workflow Efficiency**: Method + Printer combination creates logical decision tree  
‚úÖ **Reduced Rejections**: Size constraints visible upfront prevent "doesn't fit" issues

## Unified Status Model (Masterplan Alignment)

### Core Status Workflow
**Primary Flow**: `Uploaded` ‚Üí `Pending` ‚Üí `Ready to Print` ‚Üí `Printing` ‚Üí `Completed` ‚Üí `Paid & Picked Up` ‚Üí `Archived`  
**Rejection Flow**: `Uploaded` ‚Üí `Rejected` ‚Üí `Archived`

### Status Mapping Table

| **Unified Status** | **Internal Code** | **Directory** | **Description** | **Old Build Guide** |
|-------------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Uploaded | UPLOADED | Uploaded/ | Student submission received | Submitted |
| Pending | PENDING | Pending/ | Awaiting student confirmation | Approved ‚Üí Needs student confirm |
| Ready to Print | READYTOPRINT | ReadyToPrint/ | Student confirmed, ready for printing | Queued |
| Printing | PRINTING | Printing/ | Currently being printed | Printing |
| Completed | COMPLETED | Completed/ | Print finished, awaiting pickup | Completed |
| Paid & Picked Up | PAIDPICKEDUP | PaidPickedUp/ | Final successful state | Picked Up |
| Rejected | REJECTED | Rejected/ | Staff rejected submission | Rejected |
| Archived | ARCHIVED | Archived/ | Long-term storage | (new) |

### Removed Build Guide Statuses
**Consolidated/Removed** (with rationale):
- ~~"Intake Review"~~ ‚Üí Merged with "Uploaded" (staff review happens in Uploaded status)
- ~~"Approved"~~ ‚Üí Renamed to "Pending" (awaiting student confirmation)  
- ~~"Needs Info"~~ ‚Üí Use email/notes workflow instead of separate status
- ~~"Ready for Pickup"~~ ‚Üí Renamed to "Completed"
- ~~"Paused", "Failed", "Canceled"~~ ‚Üí Handle via notes/admin actions, not separate statuses

### Advantages of Unified Model
‚úÖ **Consistency**: Matches proven masterplan workflow  
‚úÖ **Simplicity**: 8 statuses vs 13 reduces complexity  
‚úÖ **File System Alignment**: Status names map directly to directory structure  
‚úÖ **Analytics Ready**: Compatible with masterplan reporting  
‚úÖ **Migration Path**: Clear upgrade path to full system

## Lessons

### Technical Notes
- **Person Field Claims**: Always use `"i:0#.f|membership|" & Lower(User().Email)` format
- **Delegation**: Filter galleries with explicit OR conditions rather than "in" operator for better performance
- **Flow Testing**: Always test with real user accounts, not admin accounts for permission validation
- **Column Names**: Use consistent internal names in provisioning script to avoid Power Apps mapping issues
- **File Validation**: Use helper text + staff rejection workflow rather than client-side validation for security
- **Power Automate Null Handling**: Always use `if(equals(value, null), fallback, function(value))` pattern before type conversion functions like `int()` or `length()`; `coalesce()` doesn't work reliably in Power Automate expressions
- **Apply to Each Null Arrays**: Use `if(equals(arrayValue, null), json('[]'), arrayValue)` pattern in Apply to each inputs; Apply to each actions cannot iterate over null values and require valid arrays; use `json('[]')` not `createArray()` for empty arrays
- **Flow Debugging Strategy**: When flows show unexpected counts/values, always examine trigger raw outputs first; `"{HasAttachments}": false` indicates real SharePoint state, not flow logic errors
- **Flow Race Condition Prevention**: When Flow A (Create) triggers Flow B (Audit), use condition `equals(LastActionBy, 'System')` to skip Flow B during any System updates; place this as the first condition after trigger wrapping ALL other logic
- **Flow Documentation Organization**: Always place race condition prevention as Step 2 (immediately after trigger), with all remaining logic in the "No" branch; avoid scattering related conditions across different steps
- **Number Field Audit Logging**: SharePoint number fields can be null/empty and must use null-safe expressions: `if(equals(triggerOutputs()?['body/FieldName'], null), '', string(triggerOutputs()?['body/FieldName']))` for NewValue and `if(equals(value, null), 'empty', string(value))` for display in Notes; without null checks, empty number fields result in blank audit log values
- **SharePoint Internal Field Names**: CRITICAL - Always verify internal field names in SharePoint List Settings ‚Üí Column ‚Üí check URL Field parameter; display names often differ from internal names (e.g., "EstimatedWeight" display = "EstWeight" internal); using wrong name in `triggerOutputs()?['body/FieldName']` results in null values and empty audit logs; verify each field's internal name before building flow expressions
- **SharePoint Multi-Choice Field Access**: Multi-choice fields (checkboxes allowing multiple selections) return arrays of complex objects with `@odata.type`, `Id`, and `Value` properties; cannot use simple `join()` directly on the array (produces JSON object output); must use **Select** action first to extract Value properties: (1) Select action: From = `outputs('Get_Item')?['body/FieldName']`, Map = Click "Switch to text mode" button ‚Üí Type `@item()?['Value']`, (2) Compose action: `join(body('Select_Action_Name'), '; ')`, (3) Reference in email/log: `outputs('Compose_Action_Name')`; CRITICAL: Must use text mode for Map field - visual mode creates unwanted key-value pairs that produce `{"value":""}` objects instead of clean strings

### Implementation Strategy  
- **Start with SharePoint foundation** - everything depends on proper list structure
- **Test each flow individually** before building the staff console  
- **Use staged rollout** - start with staff testing before opening to students
- **Keep audit trail simple** in MVP - can enhance later based on needs
- **Simplify file handling** - For MVP, local download/work/status updates beats complex file versioning systems
- **Lightbulb toggle pattern** - Use Icon.Lightbulb/LightbulbSolid with color animation for clear on/off states; Timer control needed for glow effects  
- **Staff attribution modal pattern** - Always include mandatory staff dropdown using `colStaff` collection; validate selection before enabling action buttons; use proper SharePoint Person field formatting in Patch operations

### Documentation Best Practices
- **Eliminate forward/backward references** - Never say "see below", "copy from above", or "fill in like other sections" - include complete instructions at each step even if redundant
- **Inline templates** - Put HTML templates, code snippets, and examples directly in the step where they're used, not in separate reference sections
- **Complete field mappings** - For repetitive tasks (like Create item actions), explicitly list ALL fields every time rather than saying "same as before"
- **Sequential organization** - Users should be able to follow documentation top-to-bottom without scrolling to find referenced content
- **Delete redundant sections** - After consolidating content into main steps, remove duplicate reference sections to reduce file size and confusion

## Decision History

| Decision | Rationale | Alternative Considered |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| SharePoint Lists vs Custom DB | Native M365 integration, built-in security | Custom database would require hosting and additional security |
| Attachments vs Document Library | Simpler association model for MVP | Document library provides better file management but complex permissions |
| Canvas vs Model-Driven App | More UX control for staff workflows | Model-driven would be faster to build but less flexible |
| Multiple Flows vs Monolithic | Better error isolation and maintainability | Single flow would be simpler but harder to troubleshoot |
| Local File Workflow vs Authoritative File System | MVP simplicity, eliminates complex versioning | PrimaryAttachment columns would provide better file tracking but add complexity |

## PLANNER MODE: Power Automate Test Document Plan

### Background
User has completed building 3 Power Automate flows and needs a comprehensive test document:
- **Flow A (PR-Create)**: Request creation, ReqKey generation, filename validation, confirmation emails
- **Flow B (PR-Audit)**: Field change logging, automated status emails, student estimate confirmations  
- **Flow C (PR-Action)**: Staff action logging from Power Apps

### Test Document Structure (Planned)

#### 1. Document Organization
- **Test Scope Overview** - What's being tested and why
- **Prerequisites** - Required setup before testing
- **Test Data Requirements** - Sample data needed for testing
- **Individual Flow Tests** - Unit tests for each flow
- **Integration Tests** - Cross-flow interaction testing
- **Edge Cases & Error Scenarios** - Negative testing
- **Regression Test Suite** - Quick validation after changes
- **Test Result Template** - Standardized pass/fail tracking

#### 2. Flow A (PR-Create) Test Scenarios
**Unit Tests:**
- ReqKey generation (sequential numbering: REQ-00001, REQ-00002)
- Standardized display name generation (character cleaning: spaces, hyphens, apostrophes)
- Filename validation (valid formats: FirstLast_Method_Color.ext)
- Filename validation (invalid formats: missing segments, wrong extensions)
- No attachments rejection workflow
- Valid file confirmation email content
- Invalid file rejection email content
- AuditLog entry creation for valid submissions
- AuditLog entry creation for rejections

**Edge Cases:**
- Student names with special characters (O'Connor, Mary-Jane, Jos√© Mar√≠a)
- Multiple attachments (some valid, some invalid)
- Case sensitivity in file extensions (.STL vs .stl)
- Empty filename segments (JohnDoe__Blue.stl)
- Extra underscores in filenames

#### 3. Flow B (PR-Audit) Test Scenarios
**Unit Tests:**
- System update condition (skip when LastActionBy = System)
- Field change detection for each tracked field:
  - Status, Method, Color, Priority, Printer
  - EstimatedTime, EstimatedWeight, EstimatedCost, Notes
- Internal field name handling (EstWeight vs EstimatedWeight)
- Null-safe number field logging
- Multi-choice field formatting (RejectionReason with Select action)
- Automated email on Status = "Rejected"
- Automated email on Status = "Pending" (with cost estimates)
- Automated email on Status = "Completed" (pickup notification)
- StudentConfirmed detection and Status update
- Email audit logging (system attribution)

**Edge Cases:**
- Multiple fields changed simultaneously
- Null/empty number fields (EstimatedCost = blank)
- Race condition with Flow A (attachment count timing)
- Circular loop prevention (StudentConfirmed update)
- Status change with missing estimate fields

#### 4. Flow C (PR-Action) Test Scenarios
**Unit Tests:**
- Input validation (required vs optional parameters)
- ReqKey retrieval from PrintRequests
- AuditLog entry creation with all fields
- JSON success response format
- JSON error response format
- Actor email resolution to Person field
- FlowRunId and timestamp population

**Edge Cases:**
- Missing required parameters (RequestID, Action, NewValue, ActorEmail)
- Invalid RequestID (non-existent item)
- Blank OldValue parameter (optional)
- Long Notes text (>255 characters)
- Special characters in field values

#### 5. Integration Tests
**Flow A ‚Üí Flow B:**
- Create request ‚Üí Verify Flow A completes ‚Üí Verify Flow B skips (LastActionBy = System)
- Valid filename ‚Üí Verify no duplicate audit entries
- Invalid filename ‚Üí Verify rejection doesn't trigger Flow B field logging

**Flow C ‚Üí Flow B:**
- Staff updates Status via Power Apps ‚Üí Flow C logs action ‚Üí Flow B detects Status change ‚Üí Both create audit entries
- Verify no duplicate Status change logs
- Verify correct actor attribution (staff vs system)

**Flow B Email Triggers:**
- Status change to Pending ‚Üí Verify estimate email sent ‚Üí Student confirms ‚Üí Verify Flow B updates Status
- Status change to Rejected ‚Üí Verify rejection email ‚Üí Verify no estimate email
- Status change to Completed ‚Üí Verify pickup email ‚Üí Verify Flow B doesn't re-send on subsequent updates

#### 6. Error Scenarios
**SharePoint Failures:**
- SharePoint list temporarily unavailable
- Permission denied errors
- Item deleted during flow execution
- Concurrent modification conflicts

**Email Failures:**
- Invalid student email address
- Shared mailbox permission issues
- Email throttling (multiple sends)

**Data Validation:**
- Person field resolution failures
- Choice field value not in allowed list
- Number field with non-numeric input

#### 7. Regression Test Suite (Quick Validation)
**Critical Path Tests (15 minutes):**
1. Submit valid request ‚Üí Verify ReqKey, confirmation email, audit log
2. Change Status to Rejected ‚Üí Verify rejection email sent
3. Update single field (Priority) ‚Üí Verify field change logged
4. Call Flow C from Power Apps ‚Üí Verify audit entry created
5. Student confirms estimate ‚Üí Verify Status updates to Ready to Print

#### 8. Test Data Requirements
**Student Accounts:**
- Standard name: Jane Doe (janedoe@lsu.edu)
- Special characters: Mary O'Connor (moconnor@lsu.edu)
- Middle name: John Q. Public (jqpublic@lsu.edu)

**File Attachments:**
- Valid: JaneDoe_Filament_Blue.stl
- Invalid: model.stl (missing segments)
- Invalid: JaneDoe_Filament_.stl (empty color segment)
- Invalid: JaneDoe_Filament_Blue.exe (wrong extension)
- Mixed: 2 valid + 1 invalid

**SharePoint Test Items:**
- Clean slate: New request with minimal data
- Complete: Request with all fields populated
- Edge case: Request with null EstimatedCost/EstimatedWeight

#### 9. Test Result Template
**For each test:**
- Test ID
- Test Description
- Prerequisites
- Test Steps
- Expected Result
- Actual Result
- Status (Pass/Fail/Blocked)
- Notes/Screenshots
- Tested By
- Date

### Deliverable Structure
**File: `PowerAutomate/Testing-Guide.md`**
- Organized by flow (A, B, C)
- Progressive testing approach (unit ‚Üí integration ‚Üí edge cases)
- Copy-paste test steps with checkboxes
- Clear pass/fail criteria for each scenario
- Troubleshooting tips for common failures
- Reference links to flow documentation

### Success Criteria for Test Document
‚úÖ Non-technical staff can execute tests without assistance  
‚úÖ All critical workflows covered  
‚úÖ Edge cases identified from scratchpad lessons  
‚úÖ Pass/fail criteria are unambiguous  
‚úÖ Test execution time estimates provided  
‚úÖ Results tracking template included

### Key Lessons to Incorporate
From scratchpad analysis:
- SharePoint internal field names (EstWeight vs EstimatedWeight)
- Race condition prevention (Flow A/B timing)
- Multi-choice field formatting (text mode Map requirement)
- Null handling for number fields
- System update condition importance
- Attachment validation logic

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Test Document Created

**Deliverable:** `PowerAutomate/Testing-Guide.md` (1,900+ lines)

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Flow Naming Convention Standardization

**Action:** Updated all documentation to use standardized flow naming convention  
**Changes Made:**
- **Flow documentation headers updated** (PR-Create, PR-Audit, PR-Action) to show "Flow A/B/C" with full name as subtitle
- **Flow creation steps updated** to show both naming options
- **Power Apps integration examples updated** with note about flow name variations
- **Dashboard Design Guide updated** with naming note at top
- **Scratchpad updated** with standardized naming reference

**New Convention:**
- **Flow A (PR-Create)** - Short, clear reference in conversation
- **Flow B (PR-Audit)** - Easy to remember (A, B, C pattern)
- **Flow C (PR-Action)** - Matches testing guide structure

**Full Names (for Power Automate):**
- `PR-Create: Set ReqKey + Acknowledge`
- `PR-Audit: Log changes + Email notifications`
- `PR-Action: Log action`

**Files Updated:**
1. `PowerAutomate/PR-Create_SetReqKey_Acknowledge.md`
2. `PowerAutomate/PR-Audit_LogChanges_EmailNotifications.md`
3. `PowerAutomate/PR-Action_LogAction.md`
4. `PowerApps/Dashboard-Design-Guide.md`
5. `.cursor/scratchpad.md`

**Deliverable:** `PowerAutomate/Testing-Guide.md` (1,900+ lines)
