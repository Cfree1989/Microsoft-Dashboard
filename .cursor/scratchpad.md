# Microsoft Dashboard - 3D Print Queue System
*Planning & Implementation Tracker*

## Background and Motivation

### Project Context
Building a **comprehensive 3D Print Request Queue Management System** for LSU's FabLab using entirely Microsoft Power Platform technologies. The system must handle student submissions, staff workflow management, complete audit trails, and maintain security/privacy requirements.

### Key Requirements
- **Internal LSU accounts only** (no external access)
- **No workstation authentication** dependencies  
- **File management via SharePoint** (attachments on list items)
- **Complete staff attribution** on every action
- **Full audit logging** of all changes and activities
- **Item-level security** (students see only their requests)
- **No analytics/reporting** in MVP (keep simple)
- **No-code/low-code approach** with ready-to-use formulas

### Success Criteria
‚úÖ Students can submit 3D print requests with file attachments  
‚úÖ Staff can manage queue through intuitive interface  
‚úÖ All actions are logged with proper attribution  
‚úÖ Email notifications work automatically  
‚úÖ Security model prevents data leaks between students  
‚úÖ System is maintainable by non-technical staff

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges Identified
1. **Person Field Complexity**: SharePoint Person columns require specific claim formatting in Power Apps
2. **Delegation Warnings**: Large datasets may trigger delegation warnings in Power Apps galleries  
3. **Flow Reliability**: Power Automate flows need error handling for production use
4. **Permission Complexity**: Item-level permissions + staff access requires careful setup
5. **Field Mapping**: Internal column names vs display names can cause confusion

### Risk Assessment  
- **HIGH**: PowerShell script execution (requires proper permissions)
- **MEDIUM**: Power Apps Person field patching (technical syntax)  
- **LOW**: SharePoint list creation (well-documented process)
- **LOW**: Flow building (step-by-step guides provided)

### Architectural Decisions Made
- **SharePoint Lists over SQL**: Native M365 integration, built-in security
- **Attachments over Document Library**: Simpler for MVP, easier association
- **Canvas App over Model-Driven**: More control over UX for staff workflows  
- **Multiple Flows over Single**: Better error isolation and maintainability

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Implemented flow doc improvements: standardized Compose naming, added FlowRunId, and concurrency note.
- Enhanced provisioning script: added #Requires, fail-fast errors, unique ReqKey, and indexes.
- Updated Power Apps guidance: added IfError to Approve handler and tip to cache User().Email.

Pending next: decide if we want SP list item-level unique index for ReqKey collisions messaging in UI, and whether to add additional views.

## Lessons

### Technical Notes
- **Person Field Claims**: Always use `"i:0#.f|membership|" & Lower(User().Email)` format
- **Delegation**: Filter galleries with explicit OR conditions rather than "in" operator for better performance
- **Flow Testing**: Always test with real user accounts, not admin accounts for permission validation
- **Column Names**: Use consistent internal names in provisioning script to avoid Power Apps mapping issues

### Implementation Strategy  
- **Start with SharePoint foundation** - everything depends on proper list structure
- **Test each flow individually** before building the staff console  
- **Use staged rollout** - start with staff testing before opening to students
- **Keep audit trail simple** in MVP - can enhance later based on needs

## Decision History

| Decision | Rationale | Alternative Considered |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| SharePoint Lists vs Custom DB | Native M365 integration, built-in security | Custom database would require hosting and additional security |
| Attachments vs Document Library | Simpler association model for MVP | Document library provides better file management but complex permissions |
| Canvas vs Model-Driven App | More UX control for staff workflows | Model-driven would be faster to build but less flexible |
| Multiple Flows vs Monolithic | Better error isolation and maintainability | Single flow would be simpler but harder to troubleshoot |
