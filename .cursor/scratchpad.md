## Background and Motivation

We need to enforce a filename policy for student-submitted SharePoint list attachments without renaming files in place (to avoid link churn and confusion). The system should accept submissions whose attachment filenames follow the convention and auto-reject those that do not, notifying the student with clear instructions.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- SharePoint list attachments cannot be truly renamed; rename implies re-upload/delete, which can break links and user expectations.
- We want a low-risk, clear UX: keep the original attachment untouched, enforce naming via policy and automated validation.
- Filenames must match: FirstLast_Method_Color.ext
  - Allowed extensions: stl, obj, 3mf, idea, form (case-insensitive)
  - Must have exactly three underscore-separated segments before the extension; each non-empty.
  - Student display names may include middle names/initials; Step 3 already generates a cleaned base name used elsewhere but is not used to rename.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1) Add attachment retrieval loop
   - After Step 3 (Generate Standardized Filename), add "Get attachments" (SharePoint) and an "Apply to each" over its `value`.
   - Set loop Concurrency = 1.

2) Implement filename validation Condition inside the loop
   - Expression (replace `Apply_to_each` with your loop name if different):
   ```
   and(
     or(
       equals(toLower(last(split(items('Apply_to_each')?['Name'], '.'))), 'stl'),
       equals(toLower(last(split(items('Apply_to_each')?['Name'], '.'))), 'obj'),
       equals(toLower(last(split(items('Apply_to_each')?['Name'], '.'))), '3mf'),
       equals(toLower(last(split(items('Apply_to_each')?['Name'], '.'))), 'idea'),
       equals(toLower(last(split(items('Apply_to_each')?['Name'], '.'))), 'form')
     ),
     equals(length(split(first(split(items('Apply_to_each')?['Name'], '.')), '_')), 3),
     greater(length(first(split(first(split(items('Apply_to_each')?['Name'], '.')), '_'))), 0),
     greater(length(first(skip(split(first(split(items('Apply_to_each')?['Name'], '.')), '_'), 1))), 0),
     greater(length(last(split(first(split(items('Apply_to_each')?['Name'], '.')), '_'))), 0)
   )
   ```

3) Yes (valid) branch
   - Proceed with current flow steps (Update item, AuditLog, Confirmation email) for this item.
   - Optionally add an "AuditLog" entry noting "Attachment filename valid".

4) No (invalid) branch
   - Update the `PrintRequests` item:
     - `Status` = `Rejected`
     - `NeedsAttention` = `Yes`
     - `LastAction` = `Rejected`
     - `LastActionBy` = `System`
     - `LastActionAt` = `@{utcNow()}`
   - Create `AuditLog` item:
     - `Title` = `Rejected: Invalid filename`
     - `ReqKey`, `RequestID`, `ActionAt`, `FlowRunId` populated per existing pattern
     - `Notes` = include the offending filename `items('Apply_to_each')?['Name']`
   - Send rejection email to the student with rename instructions and accepted extensions.
   - Terminate the flow for this item (Status = Failed or Canceled) to prevent confirmation email from sending.

5) Guard confirmation email
   - Ensure the confirmation email step only executes on the valid path.
   - If email currently sits outside the loop, guard it with a check that all attachments were valid (for single-attachment scenario, checking the Condition is sufficient).

6) Documentation updates
   - Update `PowerAutomate/PR-Create_SetReqKey_Acknowledge.md` to add the new validation step, condition expression, and rejection path.
   - Add the filename policy text to the SharePoint form and to the doc.

## Project Status Board (active)

1. Add Get attachments + Apply to each after Step 3 [pending]
2. Add filename validation Condition in loop [pending]
3. Wire valid branch to proceed with existing Update/Audit/Email [pending]
4. Implement reject branch: Update item, AuditLog, rejection email, terminate [pending]
5. Guard confirmation email to run only when valid [pending]
6. Add filename policy text to SharePoint form [pending]
7. Update `PR-Create_SetReqKey_Acknowledge.md` documentation [pending]
8. Test matrix: valid/invalid names and all allowed extensions [pending]

## Success Criteria

- Valid filenames (matching pattern + allowed extension) result in normal processing and confirmation email.
- Invalid filenames cause: item marked Rejected, NeedsAttention = Yes, AuditLog entry created, and rejection email sent. No confirmation email is sent.
- Supports extensions: stl, obj, 3mf, idea, form (case-insensitive).
- No attachment rename is attempted; original attachment remains as submitted.

## Quick Reference (expressions and fields)

- Condition expression for validation (inside Apply to each): see Task 2 above.
- Offending name in emails/logs: `items('Apply_to_each')?['Name']`
- Time: `utcNow()`
- Flow run id: `workflow()['run']['name']`

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- None yet. If multiple attachments per item must all be valid before confirming, we may add an aggregate validity flag (Initialize variable before loop, set false on any invalid, check after loop).

## Lessons

- Avoid in-place rename of list attachments; prefer policy + validation to maintain link stability.

## Feature Plan: Job Card Attachments (Dashboard "Add File" Button)

### Background and Motivation
- Staff want to add files to a request directly from the dashboard job card, without navigating to SharePoint.
- Each `PrintRequests` item can hold multiple attachments; we need a simple in-app upload path with attribution (who added the file), and a clear list of files on the card.

### UX Plan
- **Collapsed job card**
  - **Attachments chip**: shows count (e.g., “3 files”).
  - **Add File button**: opens an in-app modal to attach files.
  - Optional: show the most recent 1–2 filenames.
- **Expanded job card**
  - **Attachments list**: shows all files by name (most-recent first); clicking opens the file in SharePoint.
  - **Add File button**: same as collapsed view.
- **Add File modal** (overlay)
  - **Required person selector**: “Who is adding this file?” (ComboBox bound to `Staff` list).
  - **Upload area**: attachment picker (one or multiple files in a single submit).
  - **Actions**: Save (uploads and logs), Cancel.

### Technical Approach
- **Data**: Use SharePoint list attachments on the `PrintRequests` item (no new libraries needed).
- **Display attachments**:
  - Use a small Display Form (`frmAttachmentsView`) bound to the selected request and include only the Attachments data card; place it in both collapsed (limited height) and expanded (full list) layouts.
- **Upload/remove attachments (modal, no drag-and-drop)**
  - Add an Edit Form (`frmAttachmentsEdit`) bound to `PrintRequests`, `Item = varSelectedRequest`, include only the Attachments data card.
  - Button `Add/Remove Files` → `Set(varShowAddFileModal, true); ResetForm(frmAttachmentsEdit); Set(varSelectedActor, Blank()); Set(varAttachmentChangeType, Blank()); Set(varAttachmentChangedName, Blank())`.
  - Modal shows: required person picker, the Attachments card (supports add and delete), and Save/Cancel.
  - Modal Save → `If(IsBlank(varSelectedActor), Notify("Select your name", NotificationType.Error), SubmitForm(frmAttachmentsEdit))`.
  - `OnSuccess` of `frmAttachmentsEdit` → Patch audit fields and close modal:
    - `Patch(PrintRequests, frmAttachmentsEdit.LastSubmit, { LastAction: If(varAttachmentChangeType="Removed","File Removed","File Added"), LastActionBy: varSelectedActor, LastActionAt: Now() })`
    - Optionally call Flow C (`PR-Action_LogAction`) with `Action = If(varAttachmentChangeType="Removed","File Removed","File Added")`, `Notes = Coalesce(varAttachmentChangedName, "")`.
  - Note: Canvas Attachments card supports selecting multiple files and deleting existing ones; no drag-and-drop.

### Attribution & Audit
- **Attribution**: Require selection of the actor (person picker) in the modal; store in `LastActionBy`. SharePoint will also set `Modified By` to the signed-in user.
- **Audit**: Existing `PR-Audit_LogChanges` Flow Step 5 (“Attachments Change Detection”) will log "File Added" entries automatically for each uploaded file.
- **Optional explicit log**: Also invoke `PR-Action_LogAction` from Power Apps to write a single, human-readable action entry ("File Added") with the selected actor and context notes.

### Success Criteria
- From the job card, staff can add one or multiple files without leaving the app.
- Attachments list is visible on the job card (count in collapsed view; full list in expanded view).
- Actor is captured (required) and appears as `LastActionBy`; `LastAction` updates to "File Added"; `PR-Audit` logs show file names.
- Errors show user-friendly notifications; UI disables while uploading.

### Open Decisions
- **File constraints**: Enforce client-side limits (types/size) or rely on policy only for MVP.
- **Deletion**: Expose a remove action in expanded view (staff-only) or keep read-only list in MVP.

### Task Breakdown (Planner → Executor)
1. Add attachments Display Form to job card (collapsed count + expanded list).
2. Add `Add File` button and modal state (`varShowAddFileModal`).
3. Build `frmAttachmentsEdit` with only the Attachments data card.
4. Add required person picker bound to `Staff` (`varSelectedActor`), with validation.
5. Wire Save: `SubmitForm(frmAttachmentsEdit)` → `OnSuccess` Patch `LastAction/By/At`; optional call to `PR-Action_LogAction`.
6. Add loading/disabled states and error notifications; refresh item post-upload.
7. Manual test matrix: single/multi-file, attribution required, audit entries recorded, collapsed/expanded views render correctly.
8. Documentation: Update `PowerApps/StaffConsole-AppSpec.md` and `PowerAutomate/PR-Audit_LogChanges.md` to reflect the new UI path.

### Risks & Mitigations
- DnD not native in Canvas → Mitigate with Option B (launch SP form) for immediate DnD; revisit PCF later.
- Shared devices → Require explicit actor selection; compare to `User().Email` and optionally warn on mismatch.
- Large files → Provide guidance to use document library if needed; rely on tenant limits.

### Quick Reference (formulas)
- Add File button:
  - `Set(varShowAddFileModal, true); ResetForm(frmAttachmentsEdit); Set(varSelectedActor, Blank())`
- Modal Save button:
  - `If(IsBlank(varSelectedActor), Notify("Select your name", NotificationType.Error), SubmitForm(frmAttachmentsEdit))`
- `OnSuccess` (frmAttachmentsEdit):
  - `Patch(PrintRequests, frmAttachmentsEdit.LastSubmit, { LastAction: "File Added", LastActionBy: varSelectedActor, LastActionAt: Now() }); Set(varShowAddFileModal, false)`

# Microsoft Dashboard - 3D Print Queue System
*Planning & Implementation Tracker*

## Background and Motivation

### Project Context
Building a **comprehensive 3D Print Request Queue Management System** for LSU's Fabrication Lab using entirely Microsoft Power Platform technologies. The system must handle student submissions, staff workflow management, complete audit trails, and maintain security/privacy requirements.

### Key Requirements
- **Internal LSU accounts only** (no external access)
- **No workstation authentication** dependencies  
- **File management via SharePoint** (attachments on list items)
- **Complete staff attribution** on every action
- **Full audit logging** of all changes and activities
- **Item-level security** (students see only their requests)
- **No analytics/reporting** in MVP (keep simple)
- **No-code/low-code approach** with ready-to-use formulas

### Success Criteria
✅ Students can submit 3D print requests with file attachments  
✅ Staff can manage queue through intuitive interface  
✅ All actions are logged with proper attribution  
✅ Email notifications work automatically  
✅ Security model prevents data leaks between students  
✅ System is maintainable by non-technical staff

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges Identified
1. **Person Field Complexity**: SharePoint Person columns require specific claim formatting in Power Apps
2. **Delegation Warnings**: Large datasets may trigger delegation warnings in Power Apps galleries  
3. **Flow Reliability**: Power Automate flows need error handling for production use
4. **Permission Complexity**: Item-level permissions + staff access requires careful setup
5. **Field Mapping**: Internal column names vs display names can cause confusion

### Risk Assessment  
- **HIGH**: PowerShell script execution (requires proper permissions)
- **MEDIUM**: Power Apps Person field patching (technical syntax)  
- **LOW**: SharePoint list creation (well-documented process)
- **LOW**: Flow building (step-by-step guides provided)

### Architectural Decisions Made
- **SharePoint Lists over SQL**: Native M365 integration, built-in security
- **Attachments over Document Library**: Simpler for MVP, easier association
- **Canvas App over Model-Driven**: More control over UX for staff workflows  
- **Multiple Flows over Single**: Better error isolation and maintainability

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### 🔧 EXECUTOR MODE: Flow B Attachment Count Fix - ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: COMPLETED - Successfully resolved cascading null handling issues in attachment detection
**Issue**: Multiple template errors due to null values in attachment counting logic when testing items without attachments
**Root Cause**: SharePoint items without AttachmentCount field populated causing null reference errors in length() and int() functions
**Solution Applied**: 
1. ❌ `coalesce()` approach - Power Automate rejected expression syntax
2. ✅ Fixed `Current_Attachment_Count`: `if(equals(outputs('Get_Current_Attachments')?['body/value'], null), 0, length(outputs('Get_Current_Attachments')?['body/value']))`
3. ✅ Fixed `Check_Attachments_Changed`: `not(equals(outputs('Current_Attachment_Count'), if(equals(outputs('Get_Current_Item')?['body/AttachmentCount'], null), 0, int(outputs('Get_Current_Item')?['body/AttachmentCount']))))`
**Key Learning**: Power Automate expressions need explicit null checks with `if(equals(value, null), fallback, function(value))` pattern before type conversion functions like `int()` and `length()`
**Result**: Flow B now runs successfully on items with/without attachments and with/without populated AttachmentCount field
**Time Invested**: 25 minutes
**Documentation Updated**: PR-Audit_LogChanges.md expressions corrected; Lessons section enhanced with null handling pattern

### 🔧 EXECUTOR MODE: Flow B Attachment Count Logic Analysis - ✅ COMPLETED  
**Status**: COMPLETED - Flow logic working correctly, identified real issue
**Issue**: User expected count 1→2 but got 1→0 when "adding" attachment
**Analysis Results**: Examined trigger raw outputs - `"{HasAttachments}": false` confirms item has 0 attachments
**Root Cause Identified**: Attachment upload process failing, not flow logic issue
- Previous state: 1 attachment (AttachmentCount = 1)  
- Current state: 0 attachments (HasAttachments = false)
- Flow correctly updated AttachmentCount from 1 to 0
**Key Insight**: Flow B attachment detection working perfectly - real issue is attachment not being saved to SharePoint
**Recommendation**: Debug attachment upload process (SharePoint form, Power Apps, or manual upload)
**Time Invested**: 30 minutes total
**Result**: Flow B attachment counting logic verified as accurate and reliable

### 🔧 EXECUTOR MODE: Flow A/B Race Condition Fix - ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: COMPLETED - Fixed timing conflict and corrected confusing documentation
**Issue**: AttachmentCount defaults to 1 but Flow B sets it to 0 when Flow A updates trigger Flow B during item creation
**Root Cause**: Flow A updates item → triggers Flow B → Flow B runs before attachments are fully available → counts 0 attachments
**Solution Applied**: Added condition-based exclusion as Step 2 (right after trigger) that wraps ALL Flow B logic
**Documentation Fixed**: Completely reorganized PR-Audit_LogChanges.md with proper step numbering:
- Step 2: Race condition prevention (wraps everything)
- Step 3: Get Changes for Item  
- Step 4: Field Change Detection
- Step 5: Status Email Notifications
- Step 6: Attachment Detection
**Key Pattern**: `equals(LastActionBy, 'System')` prevents Flow B during any System updates (Flow A or Flow B itself)
**Time Invested**: 15 minutes total
**Result**: Clear, logical documentation structure with race condition prevention properly positioned

### 🔧 PLANNER MODE: Documentation Field Name Correction - ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: COMPLETED - Critical documentation accuracy issue resolved
**Issue**: PR-Audit_LogChanges.md Step 3a referenced "Editor Claims" field that doesn't exist in Power Automate interface
**Resolution**: Updated all 3 instances of "Editor Claims" to correct field name "Modified By Claims"

**Changes Made**: 
- Line 83: Status Change logging section - Actor Claims field corrected
- Line 386: Advanced Implementation Notes - Person field resolution guidance updated  
- Line 487: Attachment Change Detection section - Actor Claims field corrected  
- **Additional Fix**: Lines 481, 486, 492 - Corrected attachment DisplayName references to use "Name" field
- **Expression Format Fix**: Updated all NewValue field references to use Expression format with `triggerOutputs()?['body/FieldName']` syntax instead of Dynamic content references
- **Verified**: No remaining instances of "Editor Claims" in the file, all field references corrected for actual Power Automate interface

**Root Cause Identified**: Documentation written using conceptual names vs actual Power Automate UI field names
**Impact**: Implementation blocker removed - users can now find the correct field during flow construction

**Field Name Clarifications**:
1. **Person Field Issue**:
   - ❌ **Incorrect**: "Editor Claims" (conceptual name in documentation)
   - ✅ **Correct**: "Modified By Claims" (actual Power Automate field name)
   - **Purpose**: Represents the person who last modified the SharePoint item for audit trail attribution

2. **Attachment Field Issue**:
   - ❌ **Incorrect**: "DisplayName" (SharePoint property name in documentation)
   - ✅ **Correct**: "Name" (actual Power Automate field name)
   - **Purpose**: Represents the file name of SharePoint list attachments

3. **Expression Format Issue**:
   - ❌ **Incorrect**: Dynamic content references for trigger data (causes template validation errors)
   - ✅ **Correct**: Expression format `triggerOutputs()?['body/FieldName']` for SharePoint trigger data
   - **Purpose**: Proper syntax for accessing SharePoint item field values in Power Automate expressions

**Time Invested**: 20 minutes total (including follow-up fixes)
**Final Resolution**: All field references corrected, Actor Claims expressions fixed, warning added to prevent future confusion
**Status**: User's template validation error resolved - flow will now save successfully

### 💰 EXECUTOR MODE: Estimate Approval Workflow Implementation - ✅ COMPLETED 
**Status**: COMPLETED - Student estimate confirmation workflow implemented with Option A (email links)
**Deliverables**: 
- `PowerAutomate/PR-Confirm_EstimateApproval.md` - Complete instant flow documentation for estimate confirmations
- Updated `PowerAutomate/PR-Audit_LogChanges.md` - Added "Pending" status email condition with cost estimates
- Updated `.cursor/Build Guide.md` - Modified approval workflow, added Flow D documentation, updated testing procedures
**Achievement**: Implemented complete approval-to-confirmation workflow: Staff approve → status goes to "Pending" → student gets estimate email → student clicks link → status updates to "Ready to Print"
**Business Value**: Eliminates surprise costs for students and provides proper approval gates before expensive printing begins
**Key Features Implemented**:
1. **Modified Approve Button**: Power Apps now sets status to "Pending" instead of "Ready to Print", requiring student confirmation
2. **Estimate Email Flow**: Added "Pending" status condition to PR-Audit flow that sends detailed cost estimates with confirmation links
3. **Confirmation Flow (Flow D)**: New instant HTTP-triggered flow that processes student confirmations via email links
4. **Professional UI**: Success/error pages with proper styling and clear next steps for students
5. **Complete Audit Trail**: All confirmations logged with student attribution and timestamps
6. **Security**: HTTP signature validation, status verification, and proper error handling
**Technical Implementation**:
- HTTP trigger with RequestID parameter for secure confirmation processing
- Status validation (only "Pending" requests can be confirmed)
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly error pages

## Unified Status Model (Masterplan Alignment)

### Core Status Workflow
**Primary Flow**: `Uploaded` → `Pending` → `Ready to Print` → `Printing` → `Completed` → `Paid & Picked Up` → `Archived`  
**Rejection Flow**: `Uploaded` → `Rejected` → `Archived`

### Status Mapping Table

| **Unified Status** | **Internal Code** | **Directory** | **Description** | **Old Build Guide** |
|-------------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Uploaded | UPLOADED | Uploaded/ | Student submission received | Submitted |
| Pending | PENDING | Pending/ | Awaiting student confirmation | Approved → Needs student confirm |
| Ready to Print | READYTOPRINT | ReadyToPrint/ | Student confirmed, ready for printing | Queued |
| Printing | PRINTING | Printing/ | Currently being printed | Printing |
| Completed | COMPLETED | Completed/ | Print finished, awaiting pickup | Completed |
| Paid & Picked Up | PAIDPICKEDUP | PaidPickedUp/ | Final successful state | Picked Up |
| Rejected | REJECTED | Rejected/ | Staff rejected submission | Rejected |
| Archived | ARCHIVED | Archived/ | Long-term storage | (new) |

### Removed Build Guide Statuses
**Consolidated/Removed** (with rationale):
- ~~"Intake Review"~~ → Merged with "Uploaded" (staff review happens in Uploaded status)
- ~~"Approved"~~ → Renamed to "Pending" (awaiting student confirmation)  
- ~~"Needs Info"~~ → Use email/notes workflow instead of separate status
- ~~"Ready for Pickup"~~ → Renamed to "Completed"
- ~~"Paused", "Failed", "Canceled"~~ → Handle via notes/admin actions, not separate statuses

### Advantages of Unified Model
✅ **Consistency**: Matches proven masterplan workflow  
✅ **Simplicity**: 8 statuses vs 13 reduces complexity  
✅ **File System Alignment**: Status names map directly to directory structure  
✅ **Analytics Ready**: Compatible with masterplan reporting  
✅ **Migration Path**: Clear upgrade path to full system

## Lessons

### Technical Notes
- **Person Field Claims**: Always use `"i:0#.f|membership|" & Lower(User().Email)` format
- **Delegation**: Filter galleries with explicit OR conditions rather than "in" operator for better performance
- **Flow Testing**: Always test with real user accounts, not admin accounts for permission validation
- **Column Names**: Use consistent internal names in provisioning script to avoid Power Apps mapping issues
- **File Validation**: Use helper text + staff rejection workflow rather than client-side validation for security
- **Power Automate Null Handling**: Always use `if(equals(value, null), fallback, function(value))` pattern before type conversion functions like `int()` or `length()`; `coalesce()` doesn't work reliably in Power Automate expressions
- **Apply to Each Null Arrays**: Use `if(equals(arrayValue, null), json('[]'), arrayValue)` pattern in Apply to each inputs; Apply to each actions cannot iterate over null values and require valid arrays; use `json('[]')` not `createArray()` for empty arrays
- **Flow Debugging Strategy**: When flows show unexpected counts/values, always examine trigger raw outputs first; `"{HasAttachments}": false` indicates real SharePoint state, not flow logic errors
- **Flow Race Condition Prevention**: When Flow A (Create) triggers Flow B (Audit), use condition `equals(LastActionBy, 'System')` to skip Flow B during any System updates; place this as the first condition after trigger wrapping ALL other logic
- **Flow Documentation Organization**: Always place race condition prevention as Step 2 (immediately after trigger), with all remaining logic in the "No" branch; avoid scattering related conditions across different steps

### Implementation Strategy  
- **Start with SharePoint foundation** - everything depends on proper list structure
- **Test each flow individually** before building the staff console  
- **Use staged rollout** - start with staff testing before opening to students
- **Keep audit trail simple** in MVP - can enhance later based on needs
- **Simplify file handling** - For MVP, local download/work/status updates beats complex file versioning systems
- **Lightbulb toggle pattern** - Use Icon.Lightbulb/LightbulbSolid with color animation for clear on/off states; Timer control needed for glow effects  
- **Staff attribution modal pattern** - Always include mandatory staff dropdown using `colStaff` collection; validate selection before enabling action buttons; use proper SharePoint Person field formatting in Patch operations

## Decision History

| Decision | Rationale | Alternative Considered |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| SharePoint Lists vs Custom DB | Native M365 integration, built-in security | Custom database would require hosting and additional security |
| Attachments vs Document Library | Simpler association model for MVP | Document library provides better file management but complex permissions |
| Canvas vs Model-Driven App | More UX control for staff workflows | Model-driven would be faster to build but less flexible |
| Multiple Flows vs Monolithic | Better error isolation and maintainability | Single flow would be simpler but harder to troubleshoot |
| Local File Workflow vs Authoritative File System | MVP simplicity, eliminates complex versioning | PrimaryAttachment columns would provide better file tracking but add complexity |
