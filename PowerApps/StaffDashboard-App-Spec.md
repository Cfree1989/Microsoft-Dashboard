# Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- [ ] **SharePoint lists created**: `PrintRequests`, `AuditLog`, `Staff`
- [ ] **Power Automate flows working**: Flow A (PR-Create), Flow B (PR-Audit), Flow C (PR-Action)
- [ ] **Staff list populated**: At least one staff member with `Active = Yes`
- [ ] **Power Apps license**: Standard license included with Microsoft 365

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Complete Phases 1 and 2 (SharePoint + Flows) before building the Staff Console. The app depends on these being set up correctly.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Curly Quotes Warning

**When copying formulas from this guide, you may get errors like:**
- "Unexpected characters"
- "Characters are used in the formula in an unexpected way"

**The Problem:** Document formatting often converts straight quotes `"text"` to curly/smart quotes `"text"`. Power Apps only accepts straight quotes.

**The Fix:**
1. **Best option:** Type formulas directly in Power Apps instead of copy-pasting
2. **If you paste:** Delete the quotes and retype them using your keyboard (`Shift + '`)

| Wrong (curly) | Correct (straight) |
|---------------|---------------------|
| `"Dashboard"` | `"Dashboard"` |
| `'text'` | `'text'` |

> 💡 **Tip:** If a formula shows red errors after pasting, the quotes are usually the culprit!

---

# STEP 1: Creating the Canvas App

**What you're doing:** Creating a new Canvas app with a Tablet layout, which gives you a wide screen perfect for viewing job queues.

### Instructions

1. Open **Power Apps** in your browser: [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com)
2. Make sure you're in the correct **Environment** (top right dropdown — should show "Louisiana State Universi...").
3. In the left navigation, click **+ Create**.
4. Under "Create your apps", click **Start with a blank canvas**.
5. In the popup "Start with a blank canvas", click **Tablet size** (middle option, 1084 x 1386).
6. Enter these settings:
   - **App name:** `Print Lab Dashboard`
7. Click **Create**.

> 💡 **Tip:** Tablet format gives you a wide landscape canvas—perfect for dashboards with side-by-side content.

> 📝 **Naming alternatives:** You can also use `3D Print Queue Dashboard`, `FabLab Print Dashboard`, or any name that fits your lab.

### What You Should See

- The Power Apps Studio editor opens
- A blank white screen appears in the center
- The left panel shows **Tree view** with `Screen1`
- The top shows the formula bar

---

# STEP 2: Adding Data Connections

**What you're doing:** Connecting your app to the SharePoint lists and Power Automate flow it needs.

### Instructions

1. In the left panel, click the **Data** icon (cylinder icon, 4th from top).
2. Click **+ Add data**.
3. In the search box, type `SharePoint`.
4. Click **SharePoint** from the list.
5. You may see **duplicate SharePoint connections** (both showing your email). This is normal — **click either one**, they're the same connection.
6. If prompted, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account.
7. Paste your SharePoint site URL:

**⬇️ URL: Paste into "Enter a custom site URL"**

```
https://lsumail2.sharepoint.com/sites/Team-ASDN-DigitalFabricationLab
```

8. Click **Connect**.
9. Check the boxes for these lists:
   - [x] **PrintRequests**
   - [x] **AuditLog**
   - [x] **Staff**
10. Click **Connect**.

### Adding the Power Automate Flow

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Adding a flow is DIFFERENT from adding a data source. Don't search for "Power Automate" in the data panel — those are admin connectors, not your flow!

11. Look in the **left sidebar** for a **Power Automate icon** (lightning bolt ⚡).
    - OR: In the top menu, click the **three dots (...)** → **Power Automate**
12. Click **+ Add flow**.
13. You'll see "Add a flow from this environment" with your flows listed.
14. Under **Instant**, find and click **Flow C (PR-Action)** (or whatever you named Flow C).
15. The flow is now added to your app.

> 💡 **Why only Flow C?** Flows A and B are automatic SharePoint triggers — they run on their own when items are created/modified. Only Flow C (instant trigger) is called from Power Apps buttons.

| Flow | Trigger Type | Add to Power Apps? |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Flow A (PR-Create) | Automatic (SharePoint) | ❌ No |
| Flow B (PR-Audit) | Automatic (SharePoint) | ❌ No |
| **Flow C (PR-Action)** | **Instant (Power Apps)** | ✅ **Yes** |

### Verification

**In the Data panel**, you should see:
- ✅ PrintRequests
- ✅ AuditLog  
- ✅ Staff

**In the Power Automate panel**, you should see:
- ✅ Flow-(C)-Action-LogAction

> ⚠️ **Flow Name Note:** All formulas in this guide use `'Flow-(C)-Action-LogAction'`. If your flow has a different name in Power Apps, replace accordingly.

# STEP 3: Setting Up App.OnStart

**What you're doing:** Initializing variables that the entire app will use—like knowing who's logged in, loading staff data, and defining status options.

### Instructions

1. In the **Tree view** (left panel), click on **App** at the very top.
2. In the **Property dropdown** (top left, shows "OnStart"), make sure **OnStart** is selected.
3. Click in the **formula bar** (the wide text area at the top).
4. Delete any existing content and paste this formula:

**⬇️ FORMULA: Paste into App.OnStart**

```powerfx
// === USER IDENTIFICATION ===
// Cache user info for performance
Set(varMeEmail, Lower(User().Email));
Set(varMeName, User().FullName);

// === STAFF DATA ===
// Load active staff members into a collection for dropdowns
ClearCollect(colStaff, Filter(Staff, Active = true));

// Check if current user is a staff member
Set(varIsStaff, CountRows(Filter(colStaff, Lower(Member.Email) = varMeEmail)) > 0);

// === STATUS DEFINITIONS ===
// All possible statuses in the system
Set(varStatuses, ["Uploaded", "Pending", "Ready to Print", "Printing", "Completed", "Paid & Picked Up", "Rejected", "Archived"]);

// Statuses shown in the main queue (active work)
Set(varQuickQueue, ["Uploaded", "Pending", "Ready to Print", "Printing", "Completed"]);

// === UI STATE VARIABLES ===
// Currently selected status tab
Set(varSelectedStatus, "Uploaded");

// Current page/view
Set(varCurrentPage, "Dashboard");

// Search and filter state
Set(varSearchText, "");
Set(varNeedsAttention, false);
Set(varExpandAll, false);

// === MODAL CONTROLS ===
// These control which modal is visible (0 = hidden, ID = visible for that item)
Set(varShowRejectModal, 0);
Set(varShowApprovalModal, 0);
Set(varShowArchiveModal, 0);
Set(varShowDetailsModal, 0);
Set(varShowAddFileModal, false);
Set(varShowMessageModal, false);

// Currently selected item for modals (typed to PrintRequests schema)
Set(varSelectedItem, LookUp(PrintRequests, false));

// === FORM VALIDATION ===
Set(varApprovalFormValid, false);

// === ATTACHMENT TRACKING ===
// Typed to Staff record schema
Set(varSelectedActor, LookUp(Staff, false));
Set(varAttachmentChangeType, "");
Set(varAttachmentChangedName, "");

// === EXPANDED CARDS TRACKING ===
// Track which cards are expanded (local state, not saved to SharePoint)
ClearCollect(colExpanded, {ID: -1});
RemoveIf(colExpanded, true);  // Start with empty collection
```

5. Press **Enter** or click away to confirm.

### Running OnStart to Test

6. At the top of the screen, click the **three dots (...)** next to "App".
7. Click **Run OnStart**.
8. Wait for it to complete (you'll see a brief loading indicator).

> 💡 **Tip:** You can also press **F5** to preview the app, which automatically runs OnStart.

### Understanding the Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Type |
|----------|---------|------|
| `varMeEmail` | Current user's email (lowercase) | Text |
| `varMeName` | Current user's display name | Text |
| `colStaff` | Collection of active staff members | Table |
| `varIsStaff` | Is current user a staff member? | Boolean |
| `varStatuses` | All status options | Table |
| `varQuickQueue` | Active queue statuses | Table |
| `varSelectedStatus` | Currently selected status tab | Text |
| `varSearchText` | Current search filter | Text |
| `varNeedsAttention` | Filter for attention items only | Boolean |
| `varShowRejectModal` | ID of item being rejected (0=hidden) | Number |
| `varShowApprovalModal` | ID of item being approved (0=hidden) | Number |
| `varShowArchiveModal` | ID of item being archived (0=hidden) | Number |
| `varShowDetailsModal` | ID of item for detail changes (0=hidden) | Number |
| `varShowAddFileModal` | Show attachment modal | Boolean |
| `varShowMessageModal` | Show message modal | Boolean |
| `varSelectedItem` | Item currently selected for modal | PrintRequests Record |
| `varSelectedActor` | Staff member for attribution | Staff Record |
| `varAttachmentChangeType` | Type of attachment change | Text |
| `varAttachmentChangedName` | Name of changed attachment | Text |
| `colExpanded` | ~~IDs of expanded job cards~~ (no longer used - details always visible) | Table |

> ⚠️ **Important:** Variables holding records (`varSelectedItem`, `varSelectedActor`) must be initialized with `LookUp(TableName, false)` instead of `Blank()`. This tells PowerApps the expected data type while returning an empty value.

## Understanding Where Things Go (READ THIS!)

Before you start building the UI, understand the difference between **App** and **scrDashboard** (your screen):

### Naming Convention

We use **prefixes** to identify control types at a glance:

| Prefix | Control Type | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `scr` | Screen | `scrDashboard` |
| `rec` | Rectangle | `recHeader` |
| `lbl` | Label | `lblAppTitle` |
| `btn` | Button | `btnApprove` |
| `gal` | Gallery | `galJobCards` |
| `txt` | Text Input | `txtSearch` |
| `dd` | Dropdown/ComboBox | `ddStaff` |
| `chk` | Checkbox | `chkNeedsAttention` |
| `ico` | Icon | `icoExpand` |
| `con` | Container | `conExpandedDetails` |
| `frm` | Form | `frmAttachments` |
| `tmr` | Timer | `tmrGlow` |

### Complete Tree View — All Controls

Here's the **complete Tree view** exactly as it should appear in Power Apps after all steps are complete:

> ⚠️ **Z-ORDER RULE:** TOP of list = FRONT (renders on top) · BOTTOM of list = BACK (renders behind)

> 📝 **Build Order Notes:**
> - Controls are listed in Z-order (top = front), not build order
> - Message Modal controls (btnMessageSend through recMessageOverlay) are added in **Step 16C**
> - Message display controls in galJobCards (galMessages, lblNoMessages, lblUnreadBadge, btnSendMessage) are added in **Step 16B**

```

### Key Rules

| Rule | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **App = formulas only** | Only put formulas like `OnStart` here. Never visual elements. |
| **scrDashboard = all visuals** | All rectangles, labels, buttons, galleries go here. |
| **Elements are siblings** | They sit side-by-side in Tree view, NOT nested inside each other. |
| **Galleries are special** | If you select a gallery and then Insert, the new control goes INSIDE that gallery's template. |
| **Rename immediately** | After adding a control, rename it right away (click name in Tree view). |

> 💡 **How to rename:** In the Tree view, double-click the control name (or click once and press F2) to edit it.

> 💡 **How to know what's selected:** Look at the Tree view on the left. The highlighted item is what's currently selected. When you click **+ Insert**, the new control goes into whatever is selected.

# STEP 4: Building the Top Navigation Bar

**What you're doing:** Creating a professional navigation bar at the top of the screen with page buttons.

**Controls you'll create:**
- `recHeader` — Header background
- `lblAppTitle` — App title label
- `btnNavDashboard`, `btnNavAdmin`, `btnNavAnalytics` — Navigation buttons
- `lblUserName` — User display

### First: Rename the Screen

1. **In the Tree view, double-click on `Screen1`** to rename it.
2. Type `scrDashboard` and press **Enter**.

> 💡 **Why rename?** Using consistent names makes your formulas easier to read and debug.

### Creating the Header Bar (recHeader)

3. With `scrDashboard` selected, click **+ Insert** → **Rectangle**.
4. **Rename it:** Double-click `Rectangle1` in Tree view → type `recHeader` → press Enter.
5. Set these properties:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| X | `0` |
| Y | `0` |
| Width | `1366` |
| Height | `60` |
| Fill | `RGBA(45, 45, 48, 1)` |

> This creates a dark gray header bar.

   - **Text:** `"Dashboard"`
   - **X:** `300`
   - **Y:** `12`
   - **Width:** `120`
   - **Height:** `36`

10. Set the **Fill** property (makes it highlight when selected):

**⬇️ FORMULA: Paste into Button Fill**

```powerfx
If(varCurrentPage = "Dashboard", RGBA(70, 130, 220, 1), RGBA(60, 60, 65, 1))
```

11. Set the **Color** property:

```powerfx
Color.White
```

12. Set the **OnSelect** property:

```powerfx
Set(varCurrentPage, "Dashboard")
```

13. Repeat steps 8-12 to create **Admin** and **Analytics** buttons:

| Button | X | OnSelect |
|--------|---|----------|
| Admin | `430` | `Notify("Admin features coming soon!", NotificationType.Information)` |
| Analytics | `560` | `Notify("Analytics features coming soon!", NotificationType.Information)` |

    recHeader
    lblAppTitle
    btnNavDashboard
    btnNavAdmin
    btnNavAnalytics
    lblUserName
```

# STEP 5: Creating Status Tabs

**What you're doing:** Building a row of clickable tabs that show status counts and filter the gallery.

### Instructions

1. Click **+ Insert** → **Horizontal gallery** (or search for "Blank horizontal gallery").
2. Rename it to `galStatusTabs` (click the name in Tree view to edit).
3. Position and size:
   - **X:** `0`
   - **Y:** `60`
   - **Width:** `1366`
   - **Height:** `50`

4. Set the **Items** property:

**⬇️ FORMULA: Paste into galStatusTabs Items**

```powerfx
Table(
    {Status: "Uploaded", Color: RGBA(70, 130, 220, 1)},
    {Status: "Pending", Color: RGBA(255, 185, 0, 1)},
    {Status: "Ready to Print", Color: RGBA(16, 124, 16, 1)},
    {Status: "Printing", Color: RGBA(107, 105, 214, 1)},
    {Status: "Completed", Color: RGBA(0, 78, 140, 1)},
    {Status: "Paid & Picked Up", Color: RGBA(0, 158, 73, 1)},
    {Status: "Rejected", Color: RGBA(209, 52, 56, 1)},
    {Status: "Archived", Color: RGBA(96, 94, 92, 1)}
)
```

5. Set **TemplateSize:** `165`
6. Set **TemplatePadding:** `3`


### Adding the Tab Button Inside the Gallery (btnStatusTab)

9. With `galStatusTabs` selected, click **+ Insert** → **Button**.
10. **Rename it:** `btnStatusTab`
11. The button appears inside the gallery template.
12. **First, set the size and position:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| X | `3` |
| Y | `5` |
| Width | `158` |
| Height | `40` |
| Size | `11` |
| BorderRadius | `20` |

> 💡 **Why these sizes?** 8 tabs × 165px = 1320px fits the 1366px screen width. Font size 11 ensures "Paid & Picked Up" fits.

14. Set the button's **Text** property (type directly to avoid quote issues):

```powerfx
ThisItem.Status & " " & Text(CountRows(Filter(PrintRequests, Status.Value = ThisItem.Status)))
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** We use `Status.Value` because Status is a **Choice field** in SharePoint. Choice fields store objects, not plain text, so `.Value` extracts the text.

16. Set the **Fill** property:

```powerfx
If(varSelectedStatus = ThisItem.Status, ThisItem.Color, RGBA(245, 245, 245, 1))
```

17. Set the **Color** property (text color):

```powerfx
If(
    varSelectedStatus = ThisItem.Status, 
    If(ThisItem.Status = "Pending", Color.Black, Color.White),
    RGBA(100, 100, 100, 1)
)
```

18. Set the **OnSelect** property:

```powerfx
Set(varSelectedStatus, ThisItem.Status)
```

> 💡 **Result:** Clicking a tab highlights it with its color and filters the job cards gallery.

### ✅ Step 5 Checklist

Your Tree view should now include:

```
▼ scrDashboard
    ... (header controls)
    ▼ galStatusTabs
        btnStatusTab
```

---

# STEP 6: Building the Job Cards Gallery

**What you're doing:** Creating the main gallery that displays all print requests as job cards.

### Instructions

1. Click on **scrDashboard** in the Tree view (not inside the status tabs gallery).
2. Click **+ Insert** → **Blank vertical gallery**.
3. Rename it to `galJobCards`.
4. Position and size:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| X | `0` |
| Y | `115` |
| Width | `1366` |
| Height | `653` |
| **WrapCount** | `4` |
| TemplatePadding | `8` |

> 💡 **WrapCount = 4** creates a grid layout with 4 cards per row! Each card will be approximately 330px wide.

5. Set the **Items** property:

**⬇️ FORMULA: Paste into galJobCards Items**

```powerfx
SortByColumns(
    Filter(
        PrintRequests,
        // Filter by selected status tab (use .Value for Choice fields)
        Status.Value = varSelectedStatus,
        // Search filter (searches name and email)
        If(
            IsBlank(varSearchText), 
            true, 
            varSearchText in Student.DisplayName || varSearchText in StudentEmail || varSearchText in ReqKey
        ),
        // Needs attention filter
        If(varNeedsAttention, NeedsAttention = true, true)
    ),
    "Modified",
    SortOrder.Descending
)
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** Use `Status.Value` because Status is a Choice field in SharePoint.

6. Set **TemplateSize:** `380` (fixed card height - accommodates both collapsed and expanded content)

> ⚠️ **Power Apps Limitation:** The `TemplateSize` property cannot use `ThisItem` because it's evaluated at the gallery level, not per-item. All cards must have the same height. The expand/collapse feature works by showing/hiding the "Additional Details" section within this fixed space.

> 💡 **Card Layout:** All details are always visible on the card. No expand/collapse functionality — this provides a cleaner, consistent layout.

---

# STEP 7: Creating the Job Card Template

**What you're doing:** Designing a compact job card (~330px wide × 380px tall) that shows student info, request details, and action buttons.

> 💡 **Card Layout:** With WrapCount=4, you'll see 4 cards per row. Each card is approximately 330px wide.

### Instructions

With `galJobCards` selected, you'll add controls **inside** the gallery template.

### Card Background (recCardBackground)

1. Click **+ Insert** → **Rectangle**.
2. **Rename it:** `recCardBackground`
3. Set properties:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|

| Width | `Parent.TemplateWidth` |
| Height | `Parent.TemplateHeight - 8` |
| Fill | `If(ThisItem.NeedsAttention, RGBA(255, 250, 230, 1), Color.White)` |
| BorderColor | `RGBA(220, 220, 220, 1)` |
| BorderThickness | `1` |
| RadiusTopLeft | `8` |
| RadiusTopRight | `8` |
| RadiusBottomLeft | `8` |
| RadiusBottomRight | `8` |

> 📝 **Note:** The attention icon (`icoLightbulb`) is added in **Step 14** with toggle functionality.

### Student Name (lblStudentName)

4. Click **+ Insert** → **Text label**.
5. **Rename it:** `lblStudentName`
6. Set properties:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Text | `ThisItem.Student.DisplayName` |
| X | `12` |
| Y | `8` |
| Width | `Parent.TemplateWidth - 50` |
| Height | `24` |
| Font | `Font.'Segoe UI Semibold'` |
| Size | `14` |
| Color | `RGBA(50, 50, 50, 1)` |

### Submission Time (lblSubmittedTime)

7. Click **+ Insert** → **Text label**.
8. **Rename it:** `lblSubmittedTime`
9. Set properties:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| X | `Parent.TemplateWidth - 130` |
| Y | `8` |
| Width | `120` |
| Height | `20` |
| Align | `Align.Right` |
| Size | `10` |
| Color | `RGBA(209, 52, 56, 1)` |

10. Set **Text:**

**⬇️ FORMULA: Shows relative time since submission**

```powerfx
"Submitted " & 
If(
    DateDiff(ThisItem.Created, Now(), TimeUnit.Days) > 0,
    Text(DateDiff(ThisItem.Created, Now(), TimeUnit.Days)) & "d ",
    ""
) &
If(
    Mod(DateDiff(ThisItem.Created, Now(), TimeUnit.Hours), 24) > 0,
    Text(Mod(DateDiff(ThisItem.Created, Now(), TimeUnit.Hours), 24)) & "h ",
    ""
) &
Text(Mod(DateDiff(ThisItem.Created, Now(), TimeUnit.Minutes), 60)) & "m ago"
```

> 💡 Items older than 2 days show in red to indicate urgency.

### File Name / Request Info (lblReqKey)

11. Click **+ Insert** → **Text label**.
12. **Rename it:** `lblReqKey`
13. Set properties:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Text | `ThisItem.Student.DisplayName & "_" & ThisItem.Method.Value & "_" & ThisItem.Color.Value` |
| X | `12` |
| Y | `32` |
| Width | `Parent.TemplateWidth - 24` |
| Height | `20` |
| Size | `11` |
| Color | `RGBA(100, 100, 100, 1)` |

### Email Row (lblStudentEmail)

14. Click **+ Insert** → **Text label**.
15. **Rename it:** `lblStudentEmail`
16. Set properties:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Text | `"✉ " & ThisItem.StudentEmail` |
| X | `12` |
| Y | `55` |
| Width | `Parent.TemplateWidth / 2 - 16` |
| Height | `20` |
| Size | `10` |
| Color | `RGBA(100, 100, 100, 1)` |

### Printer Label (lblPrinter)

17. Click **+ Insert** → **Text label**.
18. **Rename it:** `lblPrinter`
19. Set properties:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Text | `"🖨 " & Trim(If(Find("(", ThisItem.Printer.Value) > 0, Left(ThisItem.Printer.Value, Find("(", ThisItem.Printer.Value) - 1), ThisItem.Printer.Value))` |
| X | `Parent.TemplateWidth / 2` |
| Y | `55` |
| Width | `Parent.TemplateWidth / 2 - 16` |
| Height | `20` |
| Size | `10` |
| Color | `RGBA(100, 100, 100, 1)` |

> 💡 **Why this formula?** The Printer column includes dimensions (e.g., "Prusa XL (14.2×14.2×14.2in)") to help students check if their model fits. This formula strips the dimensions for cleaner display on staff cards, showing just "Prusa XL".

### Color Indicator (lblColor)

20. Click **+ Insert** → **Text label**.
21. **Rename it:** `lblColor`
22. Set properties:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Text | `"⬤ " & ThisItem.Color.Value` |
| X | `12` |
| Y | `75` |
| Width | `150` |
| Height | `20` |
| Size | `10` |
| Color | See formula below |

23. Set **Color** formula (matches the actual color):

**⬇️ FORMULA: Maps color names to display colors**

```powerfx
Switch(
    ThisItem.Color.Value,
    "Black", RGBA(50, 50, 50, 1),
    "White", RGBA(180, 180, 180, 1),
    "Gray", RGBA(128, 128, 128, 1),
    "Red", RGBA(200, 50, 50, 1),
    "Green", RGBA(50, 150, 50, 1),
    "Blue", RGBA(50, 100, 200, 1),
    "Yellow", RGBA(218, 165, 32, 1),
    "Dark Yellow", RGBA(184, 134, 11, 1),
    "Any", RGBA(150, 150, 150, 1),
    RGBA(100, 100, 100, 1)
)
```

> 💡 **Note:** Uses `ThisItem.Color.Value` because Color is a Choice field in SharePoint.

---

25. **Rename it:** `lblStaffNotesHeader`
26. Set properties:

### ✅ Step 7 Checklist

Your gallery template should now contain these controls (Z-order: top = front):

```
▼ galJobCards
    lblCourse
    lblCourseLabel
    lblProjectType
    lblProjectTypeLabel
    lblDiscipline
    lblDisciplineLabel
    lblCreated
    lblCreatedLabel
    lblJobId
    lblJobIdLabel
    lblDetailsHeader
    lblStaffNotesPlaceholder
    lblStaffNotesHeader
    lblColor
    lblPrinter
    lblStudentEmail
    lblReqKey
    lblSubmittedTime
    lblStudentName
    recCardBackground              ← Bottom (background)
```

Each card displays:
- Student name + submission time
- File/request info
- Email and printer
- Color indicator
- Staff notes section
- Expandable additional details

> 📝 **Added in later steps:** `icoLightbulb` (Step 14), `icoExpandCollapse` (Step 8), action buttons (Step 9), message display (Step 16B)

---

# STEP 8: Adding Expandable Details

**What you're doing:** Adding the expand/collapse icon and making the Additional Details section toggle.

### Instructions

Still inside the `galJobCards` gallery template:

### Expand/Collapse Icon — REMOVED

> ⚠️ **No longer needed:** Since all details are always visible, the expand/collapse icon has been removed. If you already have `icoExpandCollapse`, delete it or set its `Visible` property to `false`.

---

# STEP 9: Implementing Action Buttons

**What you're doing:** Adding the Approve, Reject, and Archive buttons to each job card.

### Understanding the Person Record

Before adding buttons, you need to understand how to update Person fields in SharePoint. Power Apps requires a specific format.

### Setting Up varActor

First, let's ensure varActor is set up. We'll create it on the screen's OnVisible event.

1. Click on **scrDashboard** in Tree view.
2. Set the **OnVisible** property:

**⬇️ FORMULA: Paste into scrDashboard.OnVisible**

```powerfx
Set(varActor, {
    Claims: "i:0#.f|membership|" & varMeEmail,
    Department: "",
    DisplayName: varMeName,
    Email: varMeEmail,
    JobTitle: "",
    Picture: ""
})
```

> 💡 **SharePoint Person fields** require all six properties (Claims, Department, DisplayName, Email, JobTitle, Picture) even if some are empty strings.

### Adding Action Buttons to Job Cards

Go back inside `galJobCards` gallery template. We'll place buttons at the **bottom** of each card.

> 💡 **Button Layout:** Three buttons in a row at the bottom of the card. Different buttons appear based on status.

### Approve Button (btnApprove)

1. Click **+ Insert** → **Button**.
2. **Rename it:** `btnApprove`
3. Set properties:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Text | `"✓ Approve"` |
| X | `12` |
| Y | `Parent.TemplateHeight - 50` |
| Width | `(Parent.TemplateWidth - 40) / 3` |
| Height | `32` |
| Fill | `Color.White` |
| Color | `RGBA(16, 124, 16, 1)` |
| BorderColor | `RGBA(16, 124, 16, 1)` |
| BorderThickness | `1` |
| RadiusTopLeft | `4` |
| RadiusTopRight | `4` |
| RadiusBottomLeft | `4` |
| RadiusBottomRight | `4` |
| Visible | `ThisItem.Status.Value = "Uploaded"` |

4. Set **OnSelect:**

```powerfx
Set(varShowApprovalModal, ThisItem.ID);
Set(varSelectedItem, ThisItem)
```

### Reject Button (btnReject)

5. Click **+ Insert** → **Button**.
6. **Rename it:** `btnReject`
7. Set properties:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Text | `"✗ Reject"` |
| X | `12 + (Parent.TemplateWidth - 40) / 3 + 4` |
| Y | `Parent.TemplateHeight - 50` |
| Width | `(Parent.TemplateWidth - 40) / 3` |
| Height | `32` |
| Fill | `Color.White` |
| Color | `RGBA(209, 52, 56, 1)` |
| BorderColor | `RGBA(209, 52, 56, 1)` |
| BorderThickness | `1` |
| RadiusTopLeft | `4` |

   - **Item:** `varSelectedItem`
   - **Visible:** `varShowAddFileModal`

7. In the form's Fields panel, remove all fields except **Attachments**.

### Staff Selector

8. Add combo box `ddFileActor`:
   - **Items:** `colStaff`
   - **DefaultSelectedItems:** `Filter(colStaff, Lower(Member.Email) = varMeEmail)`

9. Set **OnChange:**

```powerfx
Set(varSelectedActor, {
    Claims: "i:0#.f|membership|" & ddFileActor.Selected.Member.Email,
    Department: "",
    DisplayName: ddFileActor.Selected.Member.DisplayName,
    Email: ddFileActor.Selected.Member.Email,
    JobTitle: "",
    Picture: ""
})
```

### Save Button

10. Add button:
   - **Text:** `"Save Changes"`
   - **DisplayMode:** `If(IsBlank(varSelectedActor), DisplayMode.Disabled, DisplayMode.Edit)`
   - **OnSelect:** `SubmitForm(frmAttachmentsEdit)`

// Inside Attachments control - OnRemoveFile event  
Set(varAttachmentChangeType, "Removed")
```

### Form OnSuccess

11. Set `frmAttachmentsEdit.OnSuccess`:

```powerfx
// Update the record with action tracking
Patch(
    PrintRequests,
    frmAttachmentsEdit.LastSubmit,
    {

        LastActionBy: varSelectedActor,
        LastActionAt: Now()
    }
);

// Optional: Log to AuditLog via Flow C for detailed tracking
IfError(
    'Flow-(C)-Action-LogAction'.Run(
        Text(frmAttachmentsEdit.LastSubmit.ID),
        If(varAttachmentChangeType = "Removed", "File Removed", "File Added"),
        "Attachments",
        Coalesce(varAttachmentChangedName, ""),
        varMeEmail
    ),
    Notify("Could not log attachment action.", NotificationType.Error)
);

Set(varShowAddFileModal, false);
Set(varAttachmentChangeType, "");
Set(varAttachmentChangedName, "");
Notify("Attachments updated", NotificationType.Success)
```

// Create the message in RequestComments with Direction field
Patch(
    RequestComments,
    Defaults(RequestComments),
    {
        Title: txtMessageSubject.Text,
        RequestID: varSelectedItem.ID,
        ReqKey: varSelectedItem.ReqKey,
        Message: txtMessageBody.Text,
        Author: {
            Claims: "i:0#.f|membership|" & ddMessageStaff.Selected.Member.Email,
            Department: "",
            DisplayName: ddMessageStaff.Selected.Member.DisplayName,
            Email: ddMessageStaff.Selected.Member.Email,
            JobTitle: "",
            Picture: ""
        },
        AuthorRole: LookUp(Choices(RequestComments.AuthorRole), Value = "Staff"),
        Direction: LookUp(Choices(RequestComments.Direction), Value = "Outbound"),
        SentAt: Now(),
        ReadByStudent: false,
        ReadByStaff: true,
        StudentEmail: varSelectedItem.StudentEmail
    }
);

// Update PrintRequest to mark last action
Patch(
    PrintRequests,
    varSelectedItem,
    {
        LastAction: LookUp(Choices(PrintRequests.LastAction), Value = "Comment Added"),
        LastActionBy: {
            Claims: "i:0#.f|membership|" & ddMessageStaff.Selected.Member.Email,
            Department: "",
            DisplayName: ddMessageStaff.Selected.Member.DisplayName,
            Email: ddMessageStaff.Selected.Member.Email,
            JobTitle: "",
            Picture: ""
        },
        LastActionAt: Now()
    }
);

// Close modal and notify
Set(varShowMessageModal, false);
Set(varSelectedItem, LookUp(PrintRequests, false));
Reset(txtMessageSubject);
Reset(txtMessageBody);
Reset(ddMessageStaff);

Notify("Message sent! Student will receive email notification.", NotificationType.Success)
```

> **Note:** The `Direction: {Value: "Outbound"}` field is required for the new email threading system. Flow D will detect this and send the email with threading headers. See `PowerAutomate/Flow-(D)-Message-Notifications.md` for details.

### Adding the Send Message Button to Job Cards

Add a "Send Message" button to each job card in the gallery:

1. Inside `galJobCards`, add a **Button**:
   - **Name:** `btnSendMessage`
   - **Text:** `"💬 Message"`
   - **X:** `Parent.TemplateWidth - 470`
   - **Y:** `100`
   - **Width:** `110`
   - **Height:** `40`
   - **Fill:** `RGBA(70, 130, 220, 1)`
   - **Color:** `Color.White`
   - **BorderRadius:** `6`

2. Set **OnSelect:**

```powerfx
Set(varSelectedItem, ThisItem);
Set(varShowMessageModal, true)
```

### Message Count Badge (Optional)

To show unread inbound message count on job cards:

1. Add a label inside the gallery:
   - **Name:** `lblMessageCount`
   - **Text:** `Text(CountRows(Filter(RequestComments, RequestID = ThisItem.ID && Direction.Value = "Inbound" && ReadByStaff = false)))`
   - **X:** `Parent.TemplateWidth - 365`
   - **Y:** `95`
   - **Width:** `24`
   - **Height:** `24`
   - **Fill:** `RGBA(209, 52, 56, 1)`
   - **Color:** `Color.White`
   - **Align:** `Align.Center`
   - **BorderRadius:** `12`
   - **Visible:** `CountRows(Filter(RequestComments, RequestID = ThisItem.ID && Direction.Value = "Inbound" && ReadByStaff = false)) > 0`

> **Note:** Uses `Direction.Value = "Inbound"` to count student email replies. Inbound messages are created by Flow E when students reply to emails.

### Testing the Message Modal

- [ ] Message button appears on all job cards
- [ ] Clicking "Message" opens the modal with correct request info
- [ ] Staff dropdown defaults to current user
- [ ] Send button disabled until subject (3+ chars) and message (10+ chars) entered
- [ ] Sending creates entry in RequestComments list with Direction = Outbound
- [ ] Success notification appears
- [ ] Modal closes and resets after sending
- [ ] Flow D sends threaded email to student with [REQ-00001] in subject

# Troubleshooting

## Problem: "Unexpected characters" or formula errors after pasting

**Cause:** Curly/smart quotes from the documentation instead of straight quotes.

**What you see:**
- Red error: "Unexpected characters. Characters are used in the formula in an unexpected way"
- The quotes look like `"text"` instead of `"text"`

**Solution:**
1. Delete the quoted text in the formula
2. Retype the quotes manually using your keyboard (`Shift + '`)
3. Or type the entire formula directly instead of copy-pasting

**Example:**
```
❌ Set(varCurrentPage, "Dashboard")   ← curly quotes (from docs)
✅ Set(varCurrentPage, "Dashboard")   ← straight quotes (typed)
```

---

## Problem: "Data source not found" error

**Cause:** SharePoint connection lost or list renamed.

**Solution:**
1. Go to **Data** panel
2. Remove the broken connection
3. Re-add SharePoint connection with correct site URL
4. Reconnect to lists

---

## Problem: Flow not appearing in Power Automate panel

**Cause:** Flow not saved, wrong environment, or looking in wrong place.

**Solution:**
1. **Don't search in Data panel** — flows are NOT added through "Add data"
2. Look in the **left sidebar** for the Power Automate icon (⚡), OR go to **Action** → **Power Automate**
3. Click **+ Add flow** to see available flows
4. If flow still missing:
   - In Power Automate, open your flow and click **Save**
   - Verify you're in the same environment (check top-right dropdown)
   - Ensure the flow has a **Power Apps trigger** (instant flow)

> 💡 **Only instant flows appear!** Automated flows (SharePoint triggers) won't show up — that's correct behavior.

---

## Problem: Person field won't save (Patch fails)

**Cause:** Incorrect person field format — SharePoint Person fields require all six properties.

**Solution:** Use this exact format with all six properties:

```powerfx
{
    Claims: "i:0#.f|membership|" & Lower(userEmail),
    Department: "",
    DisplayName: userName,
    Email: Lower(userEmail),
    JobTitle: "",
    Picture: ""
}
```

> ⚠️ All six properties (Claims, Department, DisplayName, Email, JobTitle, Picture) are required, even if some are empty strings.

---

## Problem: Gallery shows all items, not filtered

**Cause:** Filter formula has errors.

**Solution:**
1. Check that `varSelectedStatus` is being set correctly
2. Verify the Status column in SharePoint matches exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Test with a simpler filter first: `Filter(PrintRequests, Status = "Uploaded")`

---

## Problem: Modals appear behind other elements

**Cause:** Z-order (stacking order) is wrong.

**Solution:**
1. In Tree view, right-click the modal overlay
2. Click **Reorder** → **Bring to front**
3. Do the same for the modal content rectangle

---

## Problem: "The specified column doesn't exist" error

**Cause:** Column internal name differs from display name.

**Solution:**
1. In SharePoint, go to List Settings → click the column
2. Look at the URL for `Field=InternalName`
3. Use the internal name in your formulas

---

## Problem: Cost calculation shows wrong value

**Cause:** Method field value doesn't match expected text.

**Solution:**
1. Check your SharePoint Method column choices
2. Ensure they're exactly "Filament" and "Resin" (case-sensitive)
3. Or update the formula to match your actual choices

# Quick Reference Card

## Key Variables

| Variable | Set By | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `varMeEmail` | App.OnStart | Current user email |
| `varIsStaff` | App.OnStart | Staff member check |
| `colStaff` | App.OnStart | Active staff collection |
| `varSelectedStatus` | Status tab click | Current filter |
| `varSelectedItem` | Button click | Item for modal |
| `varActor` | Screen.OnVisible | Person record for Patch |

## Person Field Format

```powerfx
{
    Claims: "i:0#.f|membership|" & email,
    Department: "",
    DisplayName: name,
    Email: email,
    JobTitle: "",
    Picture: ""
    Email: email
}
```

## Pricing Formula

```powerfx
Max(3.00, weight * If(method = "Resin", 0.20, 0.10))
```

## Flow C Call Pattern

```powerfx
'Flow-(C)-Action-LogAction'.Run(
    Text(ThisItem.ID),      // RequestID
    "Status Change",        // Action
    "Status",               // FieldName
    "NewStatus",            // NewValue
    varMeEmail              // ActorEmail
)
```

> ⚠️ **Replace flow name:** If your flow has a different name (like `PR-Action_LogAction` or `PR-Action: Log action`), use that name instead in all formulas.
